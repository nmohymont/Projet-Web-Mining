University of Oxford,1,United Kingdom,"The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world’s second oldest surviving university. While its exact founding date is unknown, there is evidence that teaching took place as far back as 1096.

Located in and around Oxford’s medieval city centre, the university comprises 44 colleges and halls, and over 100 libraries, making it the largest library system in the UK.

Students number around 22,000 in total, just over half of whom are undergraduates while over 40 per cent are international, representing 140 countries between them.

Called the ""city of dreaming spires"" by Victorian poet, Matthew Arnold, Oxford has the youngest population of any city in England and Wales: nearly a quarter of its residents are university students, which gives Oxford a noticeable buzz.

Oxford has an alumni network of over 250,000 individuals, including more than 120 Olympic medallists, 26 Nobel Prize winners, seven poets laureate, and over 30 modern world leaders (Bill Clinton, Aung San Suu Kyi, Indira Gandhi and 26 UK Prime Ministers, among them).

The university is associated with 11 winners of the Nobel Prize in chemistry, five in physics and 16 in medicine. Notable Oxford thinkers and scientists include Tim Berners-Lee, Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins. The actors Hugh Grant and Rosamund Pike also went to Oxford, as did the writers Oscar Wilde, Graham Greene, Vikram Seth and Philip Pullman.

Oxford’s first international student, named Emo of Friesland, was enrolled in 1190, while the modern day university prides itself on having an ‘international character’ with connections to almost every country in the world and 40% of its faculty drawn from overseas.

As a modern, research-driven university, Oxford has numerous strengths but cites particular prowess in the sciences, having recently ranked number one in the world for medicine (if its medical sciences division was a university in its own right, it would be the fourth largest in the UK) and among the top ten universities globally for life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, and the arts and humanities."
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2,United States,"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is an independent, coeducational, private research university based in the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Established in 1861, MIT aims to ‘further knowledge and prepare students in science, technology and other fields of study that will best benefit the nation and the world today’. Its motto is Mens et Manus, which translates as “Mind and Hand”.

The university lays claim to 85 Nobel Laureates, 58 National Medal of Science winners, 29 National Medal of Technology and Innovation winners and 45 MacArthur Fellows. Among its impressive alumni is Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations.

Scientific discoveries and technological advances accredited to MIT include the first chemical synthesis of penicillin, the development of radar, the discovery of quarks, and the invention of magnetic core memory, which enabled the development of digital computers.

MIT is currently organised into five different schools: architecture and planning, engineering, humanities, arts and social sciences, management and science.

It is home to around 1,000 faculty members and over 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students. MIT’s current areas of research include digital learning, sustainable energy, Big Data, human health and much more.

In addition to its emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, MIT also boasts a diverse and vibrant campus environment with a wide array of student groups. The campus is arranged over 168 acres within Cambridge, and features 18 student residences, 26 acres of playing fields, 20 gardens and green-space areas, as well as over 100 public works of art.

MIT estimates that all its living alumni have between them launched more than 30,000 active companies, created 4.6 million jobs and generated roughly $1.9 trillion in annual revenue.

Taken together, this ‘MIT Nation’ is equivalent, they say, to the 10th-largest economy in the world."
Princeton University,=3,United States,"Princeton is one of the oldest universities in the US and is regarded as one of the world’s most illustrious higher education institutions.

Founded in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, it was officially renamed Princeton University in 1896 in honour of the area where it is based, opening its famous graduate school in 1900.

Acclaimed for its commitment to teaching, the Ivy League institution offers residential accommodation to all of its undergraduates across all four years of study, with 98 per cent of undergraduates living on campus.

Its student body is relatively small, with fewer than 10,000 in total, and international students make up 12 per cent of undergraduates.

Princeton is also one of the world’s foremost research universities with connections to more than 40 Nobel laureates, 17 winners of the National Medal of Science and five recipients of the National Humanities Medal.

Faculty members who have been awarded a Nobel prize in recent years include chemists Tomas Lindahl and Osamu Shimomura, economists Paul Krugman and Angus Deaton and physicists Arthur McDonald and David Gross.

Notable alumni who have won a Nobel prize include the physicists Richard Feynman and Robert Hofstadter and chemists Richard Smalley and Edwin McMillan.

Princeton has also educated two US presidents, James Madison and Woodrow Wilson, who was also the university’s president prior to entering the White House. Other distinguished graduates include Michelle Obama, actors Jimmy Stewart and Brooke Shields, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad.

Princeton, which is consistently ranked among the world’s top 10 universities, is renowned for its campus’ park-like beauty as well as some of its landmark buildings, designed by some of America’s most well-known architects. For instance, its Lewis Library was designed by Frank Gehry and contains many of the university’s science collections. Its McCarter Theatre Center has won a Tony Award for the best regional theatre in the country.

Spread across 500 acres, the Princeton campus has about 180 buildings, including 10 libraries containing about 14 million holdings. It is popular with visitors, with about 800,000 people visiting its open campus each year, generating about $2 billion in revenue.

The Princeton area, which has a population of about 30,000 residents, is also something of a destination itself, with many attracted by its tree-lined streets and wide variety of shops, restaurants and parks.

The university is within easy reach of both New York City and Philadelphia, with the “Dinky” shuttle train providing a regular service lasting about one hour to both cities. Princeton regularly subsidises many student trips to concerts, plays and athletic events in the two cities."
University of Cambridge,=3,United Kingdom,"Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is a collegiate public research institution. Its 800-year history makes it the fourth-oldest surviving university in the world and the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world.

In total, 92 affiliates of the university have been awarded Nobel Prizes, covering every category.

The university’s endowment is valued at nearly £6 billion."
Harvard University,=5,United States,"Dating back to 1636, Harvard University is the oldest university in the US and is regarded as one of the most prestigious in the world.

It was named after its first benefactor, John Harvard, who left his library and half his estate to the institution when he died in 1638.

The private Ivy League institution has connections to more than 45 Nobel laureates, over 30 heads of state and 48 Pulitzer prizewinners. It has more than 323,000 living alumni, including over 271,000 in the US and nearly 52,000 in 201 other countries. Thirteen US presidents have honorary degrees from the institution; the most recent of these was awarded to John F. Kennedy in 1956.

Situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard’s 5,000-acre campus houses 12 degree-granting schools in addition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, two theatres and five museums. It is also home to the largest academic library in the world, with 20.4 million volumes, 180,000 serial titles, an estimated 400 million manuscript items, 10 million photographs, 124 million archived web pages and 5.4 terabytes of born-digital archives and manuscripts.

There are more than 400 student organisations on campus, and Harvard’s medical school is connected to 10 hospitals.

The university receives one of the largest financial endowments of any higher education institution in the world; it created $1.5 billion in the fiscal year ended June 2013 – more than a third of Harvard’s total operating revenue in that year.

Harvard’s official colour is crimson, following a vote in 1910, after two student rowers provided crimson scarves to their teammates so that spectators could differentiate the university’s team during a regatta in 1858."
Stanford University,=5,United States,"Stanford University has one of the largest campuses in the US and is one of the most prestigious universities in the world.

It was established in 1885 and opened six years later as a co-educational and non-denominational private institution.

Its location, less than an hour’s drive south of San Francisco next to Palo Alto, is in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, and the university is known for its entrepreneurial spirit.

This entrepreneurialism has its roots in the aftermath of the Second World War, when the provost encouraged innovation, resulting in a self-sufficient industry that would become Silicon Valley.

By 1970, the university had a linear accelerator and hosted part of the early network that would become the technical foundation of the internet.

The main campus spans 8,180 acres and is home to almost all the undergraduates who study at the university.

There are 700 major university buildings housing 40 departments within the three academic schools and four professional schools, alongside 18 independent laboratories, centres and institutes.

Stanford counts 21 Nobel laureates within its community, and numerous famous alumni associated with the university from the worlds of business, politics, media, sport and technology.

The 31st president of the US, Herbert Hoover, was part of the very first class at Stanford, and received a degree in geology in 1895. Currently, Stanford is also one of the leading producers of US Congress members.

The alumni include 30 living billionaires, 17 astronauts, 18 Turing Award recipients and two Fields Medallists.

Google’s co-founders met at Stanford while pursuing doctorate degrees, although neither ultimately completed their theses.

In total, companies founded by Stanford affiliates and alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion annual revenue, which would be the 10th largest economy in the world. These companies include Nike, Netflix, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Instagram, Snapchat, PayPal and Yahoo.

The first American woman to go into space, Sally Ride, received an undergraduate degree in physics from Stanford in 1973. Just 10 years later, she made her ascent into space.

In the five years leading up to 2012, the university embarked on a challenge to raise more than $4 billion. The fundraising exceeded this target and concluded the campaign having raised $6.2 billion, which will be used for more faculty appointments, graduate research fellowships and scholarships, and construction on 38 new or existing campus buildings.

Some of the funds have already been used for large projects, including the world’s largest dedicated stem cell research facility, a new business school campus, a law school expansion, a new Engineering Quad, a campus concert hall and an art museum.

Unofficially, the Stanford motto is a German quotation “Die Luft der Freiheit weht”, which translates as “the wind of freedom blows”."
California Institute of Technology,7,United States,"The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is a world-renowned science and engineering research and education institution, where extraordinary faculty and students seek answers to complex questions, discover new knowledge, lead innovation, and transform the future.

The alumni and faculty of Caltech have been awarded 39 Nobel Prizes, one Fields Medal, six Turing Awards and 71 United States National Medal of Science or Technology. Four chief scientists of the US Air Force have also attended the institution.

The campus is located in Pasadena, California, approximately 11 km away from downtown Los Angeles.  The school's official mascot is a beaver, paying tribute to nature's engineer.

Caltech students are also well-known for playing pranks, with one of the most famous pranks including changing the ""Hollywood"" sign to read Caltech, by covering up parts of the letters."
Imperial College London,8,United Kingdom,"Imperial College London, a science-based institution based in the centre of the capital, is regarded as one of the UK’s leading institutions.

The college has around 15,000 students and 8,000 staff, with a focus on four main areas: science, engineering, medicine and business.

The institution has its roots in the vision of Prince Albert to make London’s South Kensington a centre for education, with colleges going alongside the nearby Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum.

Imperial was granted its charter in 1907, merging the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City & Guilds College.

The institution boasts 14 Nobel Prize winners, including Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin.

Imperial’s most notable landmark is the Queen's Tower, a remainder of the Imperial Institute, built to mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887."
"University of California, Berkeley",9,United States,"The University of California, Berkeley, a public research university, is regarded as one of the most prestigious state universities in the US. Part of the University of California System, it was founded in 1868.

Berkeley’s creation stemmed from a vision in the state constitution of a university that would “contribute even more than California’s gold to the glory and happiness of advancing generations”.

Berkeley’s colours of blue and gold were chosen in 1873 – blue representing not just the California sky and ocean but also the Yale graduates who helped to found the institution; gold the “Golden State” of California.

The university is located in San Francisco’s Bay Area, where it is home to about 27,000 undergraduate students and 10,000 postgraduate students.

Berkeley faculty have won 19 Nobel prizes, mostly in physics, chemistry and economics. Recent winners include Saul Perlmutter, who won the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for leading a team that discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe, suggesting the existence of a form of dark energy that comprises 75 per cent of the universe; and George Akerlof, who won the 2001 Prize for Economics for demonstrating how markets malfunction when buyers and sellers have access to different information.

Notable alumni include novelist and journalist Jack London, Oscar-winning actor Gregory Peck, former prime minister and president of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, author Joan Didion and Women’s World Cup-winning US footballer Alex Morgan.

Berkeley has a tradition as a centre of political activism. During the 1960s and 1970s, the campus was a hotbed for student protests against the Vietnam War.

Attractions on campus include a Botanic Garden established in 1890 and the 60,000-capacity California Memorial Stadium used by the university’s sports teams.

The Golden Bear is the symbol of Berkeley’s sports teams.

Berkeley’s sporting prowess was demonstrated at the 2012 Olympics in London, when its graduates won 17 medals – 11 gold, one silver and five bronze. If Berkeley had been a country, it would have ranked joint sixth in the gold medal table, alongside France and Germany."
Yale University,10,United States,"Yale University is a private Ivy League research university which is the third-oldest higher education institution in the US.

Yale traces its history back to 1701, when it was founded as the Collegiate School in Saybrook, Connecticut, which moved to New Haven 15 years later.

In 1718 it was renamed Yale College, in honour of Welsh benefactor Elihu Yale, and it was the first university in the US to award a PhD, in 1861.

Yale’s central campus covers 260 acres of New Haven, and includes buildings dating back to the mid-18th century.

The university is made up of 14 schools, and students follow a liberal arts curriculum, covering humanities and arts, sciences and social sciences before choosing a departmental major. Students also receive instruction in writing skills, quantitative reasoning and foreign languages.

Unusually for the US, Yale students are housed in residential colleges on the model of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. There are 12 historic colleges, and construction of two more started in 2014.

Around one in five students is international, and more than half of all undergraduates receive scholarships or grants from the university.

Yale has an endowment that exceeds $25 billion (£17.3 billion), making it the second-richest educational institution in the world, and a library that holds more than 15 million volumes, making it the third-largest in the US.

Yale alumni and sports teams are known as “Bulldogs”, and many Yale graduates have gone on to notable careers in politics, the arts and science.

Four Yale graduates signed the American Declaration of Independence, and the university has educated five US presidents: William Howard Taft, Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Twenty Yale alumni have won Nobel prizes, including economist Paul Krugman, while 32 have won the Pulitzer Prize.

Other notable alumni include US secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, and actress Meryl Streep.

Yale’s campus includes many famous buildings, such as the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Sterling Memorial Library.

New Haven is a city of about 130,000 people, located two and a half hours south of Boston, and an hour and a half north of New York. It has many shops, museums and restaurants, and is close to beaches, hiking trails and historic attractions."
ETH Zurich,11,Switzerland,"Established in 1855 as the Federal Polytechnic School, a century and a half later ETH Zurich is now considered among some of the world's most prestigious universities in science and technology.

The institute has produced over 20 Nobel Prize Laureates, including the father of modern physics and the inventor of the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein.

The university, commonly known as Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich or Poly for short, has based its success on Swiss traditions of cherishing fundamental principles of freedom, individual responsibility, entrepreneurial spirit and open-minded approach to education. It remains a European research pioneer, which tries to offer practical solutions, which address worldwide challenges.

With 16 departments that conduct solid academic interdisciplinary research in subjects ranging from architecture and biology to chemistry and physics, the university makes a notable contribution to the global science and technology industry.

To achieve this, ETH Zurich heavily relies on its strong ties with researchers, foreign partners and key stakeholders who also support its cutting-edge research.

Located in Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, ETH Zurich is largely based on a modern main campus built in the outskirts of the town, with a significant endowment.

Students, who follow an intensive course of academic study, have the chance to attend regular exhibitions and concerts, but also to benefit from the numerous academic events held on campus, acting as a meeting point for some of the best scientists in Europe.

Since the 1880s, university students have had the opportunity to hit the dancefloor at the classic ball event Polyball, enjoying the performance of a live orchestra and famous national singers."

The University’s core values are defined as “Freedom of thought, Embrace of diversity”.

Throughout its history, Peking University has played an integral role in the advancement of knowledge and the betterment of society. Generations of preeminent scholars, politicians, entrepreneurs, and innovators educated at Peking University have profoundly shaped China’s modernization and will continue to pioneer the nation’s developments.

Peking University celebrated the 120th anniversary of its founding in 2018. In 2019, Peking University launched its Global Excellence Strategy, characterized by CLOUDS (an acronym for its goals of Creativity, Leadership, Openness, Uniqueness, Diversity and Shaping), which has ushered in a new era of international development for Peking University."
University of Pennsylvania,14,United States,"Given its status as one of the nine original Colonial Colleges – institutions established before the US became a sovereign nation after the American Revolution – and a founding member of the Association of American Universities, it is no surprise the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) claims to be the first fully fledged (multi-faculty) “university” in the USA.

Though Penn’s origins date back to 1740, it was until 1749 when Benjamin Franklin published his famous essay,Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth, circulated it among Philadelphia’s prominent citizens, and organized 24 trustees to form an institution of higher education based on his proposals. It was 30 years later when Penn was granted university status. Since then, Penn has expanded into a sprawling 302-acre campus with 200 buildings. It boasts many notable “first” landmarks on campus including the country’s first student union, double-decker college football stadium, and the world’s first collegiate business school – The Wharton School.

Penn’s prowess is not restricted to just infrastructure. The university has an exhaustive list of notable alumni from all walks of life. Penn has affiliations with over 25 Nobel Laureates including physicist Raymond Davis Jr and economist Lawrence Klein, and has accounted for numerous heads of state. Ninth president of the USA, William Henry Harrison, trod the boards at Penn in 1791, while Nnamdi Azikiwe – former president of Nigeria – and Kwame Nkrumah – former prime minister and president of Ghana – both gained multiple degrees from the institution. Noted modernist poets and friends Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams are among the literary luminaries from the institution."
The University of Chicago,15,United States,"The University of Chicago came to life in the twilight of the 19th century, with the state of Illinois issuing its official certificate of incorporation in September 1890. A $600,000 pledge from oil magnate John D. Rockefeller helped to get the university off the ground, while local department store owner Marshall Field donated land. The vision of the university’s first president was of a “bran splinter new” institution “as solid as the ancient hills” – a modern research university with a commitment to equal opportunities and non-sectarianism.

This vision has been at the core of Chicago’s existence, enshrined in its motto: Crescat scientia; vita excolatur (“Let knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched”). The university has lived up to this by being at the forefront of major academic endeavour and discovery. It has connections to more than 80 Nobel laureates, 30 National Medal winners (across humanities, arts and science) and nine Fields Medallists. It has also been awarded nearly 50 MacArthur “genius grants”.

Current faculty who have won a Nobel prize while at Chicago include economists Robert E. Lucas (1995), James J. Heckman (2000), Roger Myerson (2007), Lars Peter Hansen (2013), Eugene Fama (2013), and physicist James Cronin (1980). Ngô Bao Châu, the first Vietnamese to win the Fields Medal (2010), is the Francis and Rose Yuen distinguished service professor in Chicago’s department of mathematics.

Notable alumni of Chicago include authors Saul Bellow and Susan Sontag, astronomer Edwin Hubble, film critic Roger Ebert, and everyone’s favourite celluloid academic and archaeologist, Indiana Jones – who also taught at the university.

While Chicago routinely ranks in the world’s top institutions academically, its prowess extends to the sporting arena. It was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference, the oldest, highest-level intercollegiate athletics conference in the US. Today the university sponsors 19 intercollegiate sports, which cater for more than 500 participants and 330 competitions taking place each year. They all play under the same name, “the Maroons”, which the university was nicknamed on account of its official colour.

The university’s campus sprawls over more than 210 acres in the Hyde Park and Woodlawn neighbourhoods, which lie south of downtown Chicago. Its first buildings were modelled on the Gothic style of the University of Oxford, but by the mid-20th century, modern buildings had begun popping up to intersperse old and new. It now blends a mix of classical and contemporary architecture from the Mitchell Tower and Robie House, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s historic residence, through to the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle.

The city of Chicago itself is the university’s “laboratory, playground, and muse”, with downtown highlights encompassing restaurants, shopping and cultural attractions. In one day you could visit the Navy Pier amusement park, the Art Institute of Chicago or shop on the Magnificent Mile.

With satellite campuses and facilities overseas, UChicago has transcended its US geography to make itself an international institution. It invites prospective students to step inside its walls and “walk along the paths of Nobel laureates, pathbreaking researchers, and tomorrow’s leaders”."
Johns Hopkins University,16,United States,"Founded in 1876, Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is a private research university based in Baltimore, Maryland. It takes its name from its first benefactor, the American abolitionist, philanthropist and entrepreneur, Johns Hopkins.

Cornell University,=18,United States,"Founded in 1865, Cornell University is a private Ivy League university with a mission to “discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge”. A federal land grant university with a private endowment, Cornell has six locations across the world. Its main campus in Ithaca, New York State, covers 2,300 acres of the Finger Lakes region, and is so extensive that students can go hiking without even leaving the university.

It also has a graduate school of medical sciences in New York city, a base in Rome where students study art, architecture and urban planning, a centre for students to gain work experience in Washington DC, and a medical college at Education City in Doha, Qatar.

Cornell counts 45 Nobel laureates among its faculty members and alumni. Other notable alumni include Tsai Ing-wen, the president-elect of Taiwan, and Huey Lewis, frontman for the band Huey Lewis and the News.

The university boasts a number of unique student traditions, such as Dragon Day, when, in late March each year, a huge dragon is paraded across campus by first-year students of the College of Architecture, Art and Planning. Heckled by rival students from the College of Engineering, the dragon is then burned in Cornell’s Arts Quad. This ritual can be traced back to high jinx of the architecture class of 1901, and was formalised by students in the 1950s.

Another tradition that has continued since Cornell’s opening in 1868 is the Cornell Chimes – daily bell performances by “chimesmasters”. These performers are selected by rigorous, 10 week long competitions, although chimesmasters do not need to have any previous experience playing the chimes. After climbing the 161 steps to the top of the historic McGraw Tower where the bells are housed, chimesmasters play from a collection of more than 2,500 songs, from musicians ranging from Schubert to the Beatles."
"University of California, Los Angeles",=18,United States,"University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) offers opportunities for inquiry, discovery, and education – and yet is a close community that provides a sense of belonging.

UCL,22,United Kingdom,"UCL was founded in 1826 to bring higher education to those who were typically excluded from it. In 1878, it became the first university in England to admit women on equal terms as men.

Located in the heart of London, UCL is a constituent college of the University of London and a member of the Russell Group, with approximately 850 professors and over 6,000 academic and research staff.

UCL comprises 11 faculties: Arts and Humanities, Built Environment, Brain Sciences, Engineering, the Institute of Education, Laws, Life Sciences, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Medical Sciences, Population Health Sciences, and Social and Historical Sciences.

Throughout its history, UCL has been the birthplace of numerous significant scientific discoveries, with 29 Nobel Prizes awarded to UCL students or staff, including William Ramsay, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904 for his discovery of the noble gases.

In addition, the UCL academic community includes 53 Fellows of the Royal Society, 51 Fellows of the British Academy, 15 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and 117 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences.

The student body is nearly 36,000-strong and UCL has one of the largest systems of postgraduate study in the country. Nearly 52 per cent of students are engaged in graduate studies.

Students hail from approximately 150 countries worldwide making up more than one-third of the university’s entire student population.

UCL was the first British university to open a campus in Doha, Qatar, where it runs a centre for the study of cultural heritage. It also has a presence in Adelaide, South Australia, which includes a space science and an energy policy institute.

University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,23,United States,"A public university founded in 1817, the University of Michigan had a rustic beginning. At its campus in Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, cows owned by the faculty once grazed, and as late as 1845, wheat was grown on site as part of a janitor’s remuneration.

By 1866, the university had become the largest in the country. Now, the University of Michigan is one of the biggest research universities in the United States. It boasts alumni including Gerald Ford, former US president; Larry Page, co-founder of Google; and actor James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader.

The university’s sporting tradition began in 1865, and its sports teams, collectively known as the Michigan Wolverines, have won more than 50 national championships in 12 sports. Why the wolverine became the university’s mascot is a mystery, as although the nickname caught on in the middle of the 19th century, the first verified sighting of the animal in Michigan state did not occur until 2004.

Michigan’s mission is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through “preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future”. It offers 250 undergraduate majors, 100 doctoral and 200 master’s programmes, as well as more than 1,400 student clubs.

The university has no shortage of bizarre traditions. On campus sits “The Cube”, a huge black object so finely balanced on one corner that students can spin it around despite its great weight. One myth is that the president gives it a push each morning in order to keep the campus running smoothly.

When students first arrive at Michigan they walk through a campus fountain to make them an “official wolverine”. After graduation, they walk the other way through the water, signifying their departure to join the professional world. And don’t step on the brass “M” at the centre of the campus, or exam failure awaits."
Carnegie Mellon University,24,United States,"Located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private, global research university, and one of just 25 universities to be admitted to the World Economic Forum’s Global University Leaders Forum.

Its motto is ‘My heart is in the work’.

Established in 1900 by the famous industrialist Andrew Carnegie, initially as the Carnegie Technical Schools, the university became the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912. In 1967 it merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, resulting in its present incarnation.

CMU emphasises close collaborations between faculty and students to address scientific, technological and societal challenges, as well as making things ‘from art to robots’.

The university lays claim to many examples of ground-breaking inventions and pioneering research into brain science, data, start-ups and driverless cars, among others. It was the first institution (via professor Scott Fahlman in 1982) to create a ‘smile’ in an email.

Its cohort numbers well over 13,000 students from 114 countries, and a faculty of more than 1,400.

With its strong focus on creating new things, CMS says that many of its students go on to join some of the world’s most successful companies. The Association of University Technology Managers has ranked it first among US institutions for start-up companies created per research dollar spent, between 2008 and 2012.

As well as its US locations in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley, Carnegie Mellon has a campus in Doha, Qatar, and offers degree programmes in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America.

CMU boasts many student traditions with a distinctly Scottish flavour that owe their heritage to its Scottish-American founder, Andrew Carnegie. They include celebratory bagpipe playing on campus and the kilt-wearing student marching band known as the ‘Band Without Pants.’

The university has been home to a total of 19 Nobel Laureates and is the recipient of a vast array of other prestigious awards."
University of Washington,25,United States,"The University of Washington is one of the largest and most prestigious higher education institutions on the west coast of the US.

Founded in 1861 as the Territorial University of Washington, the institution expanded with the city of Seattle during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, moving to its current site in 1895.

The 700-acre park-like campus, which borders two lakes in Seattle, is now home to 16 schools and colleges offering courses ranging from undergraduate to doctoral level. The university also has campuses in Bothell and Tacoma which offer bachelor’s and master’s degrees.

The University of Tokyo,26,Japan,"A message from the University of Tokyo

Established by the Japanese government in 1877, not long after the country's reopening to the world,the University of Tokyo (UTokyo)has played a leading role in Japan's modernization and development. In 2004, UTokyo was incorporated as an institution independent from the government, ushering in a new era of autonomy. With our 150th anniversary approaching in 2027, UTokyo continues to evolve as a pioneer in education and research.

Guided by our commitment to serve the global public, UTokyo pushes the frontiers of knowledge through interdisciplinary collaboration and groundbreaking research. Promoting academic freedom and diversity, we provide a rich curriculum in both the liberal arts and advanced specializations, empowering students to become global leaders. UTokyo aspires to be a university that is open to the world̶where scholarship thrives, unhindered by barriers.

As a pioneer in research and education, UTokyo believes that embracing a pluralistic, accepting approach in everything we do is imperative for pushing new boundaries and developing future global leaders. That's why, in June 2022, we adopted our Statement on Diversity & Inclusion. This document both reiterates and uplifts the principles of the university's charter, promoting respectful, continuous dialogue and banning any form of discrimination, including in decision-making processes. The statement not only facilitates inclusion within the university but extends this principle to all who cooperate with the institution, promoting a sense of belonging and respect for everyone.

UTokyo's undergraduate programs are structured into a two-tier system: the first two years comprise general education in the College of Arts and Sciences, while the last two years involve specialized education in the student's chosen faculty and department. This ""late specialization"" model provides students with a broad liberal arts foundation before they pursue focused study in their majors.

Following Japan's standard academic calendar, UTokyo's school year begins in April. However, in response to globalization, select undergraduate and graduate programs taught in English have adopted autumn admission to meet growing international demand and diversify student perspectives.

For nearly 150 years, UTokyo has exemplified Japan's tradition of academic excellence and ingenuity across a wide range of disciplines. A recent study revealed that, UTokyo scholars produced high-impact publications on over 17,000 research topics. This remarkable achievement reflects UTokyo's culture of boundary-pushing rigor across the academic spectrum. Unlike many Japanese universities that focus on only certain fields, UTokyo pursues excellence in all areas of scholarship. Our researchers unlock insights stretching from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to interdisciplinary frontiers.

This comprehensive ethos stems from UTokyo's mission to advance knowledge for society's benefit. While honoring Japan's scholarly traditions, UTokyo also promotes ever-greater global research engagement in English and other languages. By bridging academic cultures and languages, UTokyo seeks to expand the vistas of human understanding."
Technical University of Munich,27,Germany,"Winged by its entrepreneurial spirit, and encouraged by its proven potential for progressive change, the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has become Germany’s flagship university of technology, awarded the title “University of Excellence” three times in row since the birth of Germany’s Excellence Initiative.

The central mission aims to enabling diverse talent across all levels, advancing education, new knowledge creation, and entrepreneurial venturing, and shaping future labor markets aligned to society’s values and the needs of our natural environment. From a transnational community of curious, open-minded students all the way up to global alumni, TUM leverages the intelligence of the entire TUM family, mobilizes the unique Greater Munich’s science and industry network, and partners with leading global institutions."
Duke University,28,United States,"Duke University, located in the US state of North Carolina, is one of the wealthiest private universities in America and a top producer of international scholars.

It was founded in 1838 as Trinity College but became known as Duke University only in 1924 after the Duke Endowment was established. The university describes itself as younger than most other prestigious research universities in the country.

The original campus was rebuilt in Georgian architecture as is now known as East Campus, after the 1930 addition of West Campus, Gothic in style and home to the impressive Duke Chapel tower.

There are 10 schools and colleges; the oldest is Trinity College of Arts & Sciences, founded in 1859, and the youngest is the Nicholas School of the Environment, established just 25 years ago.

About 95 per cent of all students graduate within four years of enrolling. In the 2015 entry class, the most popular majors were public policy, economics, biology, biomedical engineering and psychology.

Sports and performance art both thrive at Duke University, which competes in athletics and basketball, and hosts more than 60 art events a year.

In 2014, Duke Kunshan University opened in China, with the aim of integrating liberal arts education with Chinese tradition. Duke also has a partnership with the National University of Singapore to collaborate on a joint medical programme, which took its first students in 2007.

Overall, the university is one of the most competitive to get into. For the “Class of 2019” cohort, only 11.4 per cent of the applicants received a place.

Unusually, the university requires undergraduates to live on campus for the first three years. More than 75 per cent of the students also pursue volunteering opportunities, supporting the university’s mission, “knowledge in service to society”.

The most notable alumnus is Richard Nixon, the 37th president of the United States. He graduated from Duke University with a law degree in 1937. Duke alumni also head many Fortune 500 companies including Apple, Cisco Systems, JPMorgan Chase and PepsiCo.

Northwestern University,30,United States,"When it opened for business in 1855, Northwestern University had only two academic staff and 10 students. These were all male, but women have been admitted since 1869.

Northwestern owes its existence to the vision of its nine founders who, with no land, limited finances and little knowledge of higher education, determined to create a university for the vast Northwest Territory covering more than five of today’s states. They began planning in 1850 and, three years later, boldly went ahead and purchased a 379-acre site close to Lake Michigan and developed the campus at Evanston, named after a founder called John Evans.

From these small beginnings, Northwestern has developed into a leading private research university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence. It now consists of 12 separate schools and colleges and is notable for its research strength in fields including neuroscience, nanotechnology, biotechnology and the development of new drugs. The main campus is still based at Evanston, 10 miles north of Chicago, although there is a smaller one in Chicago, so students enjoy all the stimulus and opportunities for personal and professional development provided by one of the world’s great cities. Since 2008, there has also been a third, satellite campus in Doha, Qatar.

Northwestern’s mascot is Willy the Wildcat. Its mottoes are both taken from the New Testament and read, in Latin and Greek, “Whatsoever things are true” and “The world is full of grace and truth”.

Celebrated alumni include novelist Saul Bellow and economist George Stigler, who both went on to win Nobel Prizes, as well as Friends star David Schwimmer,Gone Girlauthor Gillian Flynn, and George R. R. Martin, whose novels inspired the Game of Thrones television series. No fewer than four economists and one chemist who worked as faculty at Northwestern went to receive Nobel Prizes. And the diplomat and political scientist Ralph Bunce, who had been a researcher there, went on to become the first African American to win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict."

It was founded in the late 1800s by Fabian Society members Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw for the purpose of bettering society, ‘by studying poverty issues and analysing inequalities.’

The philosopher Bertrand Russell taught there in 1895-96 and 1937-38, helping to define the LSE’s ethos. In 1900, it joined the federal University of London and has remained a member ever since, rapidly expanding to its current position near Aldwych in central London, where King George V laid the first stone of its 'Old Building' in 1920.

The LSE boasts associations with 16 Nobel Prize winners and counts 37 past or present world leaders among its alumni. Bertrand Russell received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, recognising his writing on ‘humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought’, while Mick Jagger attended as an undergraduate in 1961, dropping out after a year to form the Rolling Stones.

British Prime Minister Clement Attlee was an assistant lecturer there in 1912 and one of the first teachers in the new Department of Social Science and Administration. Lord Beveridge separately was appointed director of the LSE in 1937, later authoring the famousBeveridge Report, a cornerstone of the UK’s welfare state.

The LSE students’ union has twice courted controversy in the past half century, first in a series of riots in 1967 to protest the appointment of director Sir Walter Adams, who had worked as a principal in Zimbabwe under white rule. And again in 1989, when students elected Winston Silcott as their honorary president, after Silcott’s murder conviction (later overturned) during London’s infamous Broadwater Farm riot.

Today, the LSE is world-renowned. Home to 9,600 full time students from some 140 countries, it maintains international partnerships with Columbia University in New York, Sciences Po in Paris, Peking University in Beijing, the National University of Singapore and the University of Cape Town."
Karolinska Institute,=53,Sweden,"The Karolinska Institute, based in Stockholm, Sweden, is among the world’s leading medical universities.

Its vision is to contribute to the improvement of human health via research and teaching. The institution, which has around 6,000 students, is located close to the Karolinska University Hospital. The Karolinska Institute’s research spans the whole field of medicine, from basic experimental research to patient-oriented and nursing research. The institution is the single largest conductor of academic medical research in Sweden.

The Karolinska Institute was founded by King Karl XIII in 1810 as an academy for the training of surgeons, after one in three soldiers wounded in a war against Russia died in field hospitals. In 1861, the institution was granted the right to confer degrees and gained a status equal to that of a university. In 1895, Alfred Nobel's will bequeathed the Karolinska Institute the right to select the winner of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.

Since then, five Karolinska Institute researchers have won a Nobel Prize in that category. In 1997, the institution was granted full university status. The institution has two campuses: KI Campus Solna and KI Campus Huddinge, located in the northwest and south of Stockholm respectively. Both campuses are a 10-15 minute walk or train ride from the centre of the city. As well as bachelor’s and master degrees, the Karolinska Institute also offers doctoral degrees. To gain a PhD, students must develop an advanced general knowledge of medical science and scientific methodology, as well as cutting edge scientific skills in the research field they choose to explore in their thesis."

Schools, Academies, and Institutes"
Kyoto University,61,Japan,"Kyoto University is Japan’s second oldest university and one of Japan’s “National Seven”, founded as Kyoto Imperial University in 1897 on the island of Honshu, the nation’s ancient former capital.

Initially comprising the colleges of law, medicine, letters, and science and engineering, within two years the university had also opened a library and hospital. Soon afterwards, came faculties of economics, agriculture and humanities, while its first graduate school was launched in the mid-20th century.

Today, Kyoto has 10 faculties, 18 graduate schools and more research institutes – 14 in total – than any other Japanese university.

The institution is spread over three campuses: Yoshida, the main campus – dominated by the Clock Tower Centennial Hall, which dates back to when the university was first established – and two further bases at Uji and Katsura.

Kyoto itself is a city rich in culture and history, surrounded by mountains on three sides and bestriding the Kamo River. Architectural gems such as the Kyoto Imperial Palace – the former home of the Emperor of Japan – serve as a reminder of the city’s historical significance, while a number of its temples have been classed as Unesco World Heritage Sites.

Aside from the surroundings, many of its 23,000-strong student cohort, including around 2,000 international students, are attracted by the university’s reputation as a centre of research excellence: it has been home to nine Nobel prizewinners and two Fields medal recipients.

Kyoto University also houses the Hakubi Project, set up in 2009 to develop the talents of outstanding young researchers.

Notable alumni include film director Nagisa Oshima and novelist Kan Kikuchi."
Nanjing University,=62,China,"Nanjing University, which traces its history back to 1902, is one of China’s leading public higher education institutions.

It is a member of the C9 League, a group of leading higher education institutions which are often likened to the US Ivy League or the UK’s Russell Group, and which receive additional funding from the Chinese government.

The university is located in the city of the same name, in Jiangsu province, about 185 miles west of Shanghai.

It offers a range of multi-disciplinary courses, in areas such as the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering and management.

In total, Nanjing has 21 schools, running courses at undergraduate, postgraduate and research level. The university has one of China’s largest libraries, holding more than 4.5 million volumes.

These activities are spread across three campuses: in Gulou in the city centre; Pukou, on the northern bank of the Yangtze River; and the Xianlin international campus, to the east of the city.

The university claims to have played a central role in the development of Chinese politics and society.

A group of communists from Nanjing Higher Normal School, a forerunner of the modern institution, are credited with introducing the theory of Marxism to the Chinese general public in the early 1920s.

Scholars and students from the institution also played a key role in the country’s fight against Japanese occupation, and in the development of the modern Chinese state.

Nowadays the university has built links with higher education institutions around the world, and has set up several collaborative institutes, including the Centre for Chinese and American Studies, a partnership with Johns Hopkins University."

We also operate an environmental research center on Lake Tahoe, a marine laboratory at Bodega Bay and an MBA program in the San Francisco Bay Area."
Brown University,65,United States,"Founded in 1764, Brown is the seventh oldest university in the United States, and one of its most renowned higher education institutions. It is part of the Ivy League and, as an institution that prides itself on openness, was the first of the members to accept students from all religious affiliations.

Originally called the College of Rhode Island, Brown’s first home was Warren, Rhode Island before it relocated to College Hill, overlooking the state’s capital city Providence, in 1770. Some 34 years later, in recognition of a $5,000 gift from alumnus and leading Providence businessman Nicholas Brown, the university was renamed to reflect today’s title.

Today’s picturesque campus is made up of 230 buildings over 150 acres within walking distance of downtown Providence and close to the lively Thayer Street, Wickenden Street and Wayland Square where students and local residents mix, among ample shopping, dining and entertainment.

The university’s sports teams play under the name of the “Brown Bears”. Theodore Francis Green, a former Rhode Island governor and US senator, introduced a brown bear as the university’s mascot. Today, Bruno the Brown bear is still the university’s prime cheerleader.

A defining characteristic of the university was its introduction of the “Brown Curriculum”, which altered undergraduate education immeasurably at the institution. It was inspired by Francis Wyland, Brown’s fourth president, who argued that a student should have the freedom to “study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose”. The new “Open Curriculum”, which was launched in 1970, allowed students to develop their own core curriculum rather than be bound to a prescribed “liberal arts education”. It has defined Brown’s undergraduate experience to this day.

Besides study, Brown is a leading research institution. The university has connections to seven Nobel laureates including alumni Craig C. Mello and Jerry White who won for physiology or medicine and peace respectively, and current physics faculty member Leon Cooper. Fields Medal winner David Mumford is emeritus professor of applied mathematics at the university.

Brown’s diverse student body is exemplified by notable alumni from all walks of life. From the father of American education Horace Mann and The Office star John Krasinski, to Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark and financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, the university’s people are varied. Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, graduated from Brown in 2014, having transferred from the University of Oxford."
Wageningen University & Research,66,Netherlands,"Wageningen University and Research has the unique position of being the only university in the Netherlands to focus on healthy food and the living environment. Wageningen University & Research's history dates back to 1876, when it opened as a national agricultural college.

Wageningen University & Research consistently ranks as one of the world’s top universities. In its life sciences specialism in particular, it’s considered one of the best universities in the world.

Its mission is ""to explore the potential of nature to improve the quality of life"". The university’s 20 bachelor programmes all share this common theme, from agrotechnology, to molecular life, to international land management.

The university has six English taught programmes.

The university’s expertise in food and the environment puts it in high demand to produce research for the Dutch government, businesses and nonprofits. Its facilities are commissioned by these groups to explore new solutions for healthy living. Their projects have ranged from seeking innovation in sustainable energy to finding ways of making plastic from seaweed.

Fittingly, given its focus on the healthy natural environment, Wageningen University & Research made it a goal to become carbon neutral, and achieved this goal in 2015.

The town of Wageningen, where the university is based, is a historic town on the banks of the Rhine. Each year in May the town holds a festival which draws in thousands of visitors, celebrating the town’s significance as the site of the liberation of the Netherlands at the end of the Second World War."
Washington University in St Louis,67,United States,"The Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) was founded in 1853 by Wayman Crow, a St. Louis merchant, and William Greenleaf Eliot, a religious minister (and the grandfather of poet TS Eliot), in response to the lack of higher learning institutions in the growing Midwest.

Named after George Washington, the university is now a private research institution with around 16,500 students drawn from all 50 US states and more than 110 different countries.

WashU is organised around seven schools: art and architecture, arts and sciences, business, continuing education, engineering, law, medicine, and social work and public health. It comprises over 175 buildings spread across five, centrally-located campuses.

The main Danforth Campus is the academic home to the majority of the university's undergraduate, graduate and professional students. The Washington University Medical Camous is home to the School of Medicine.

Other WashU campuses include the site of a former St. Louis department store and another that comprises a 2,000-acre outdoor laboratory for learning and research.

The university claims several areas of research focus including biotechnology, plant science and business development.

With several strategic partnerships in place at global universities, WashU students have various opportunities to travel and study abroad. Among them are elective rotations for medical students in overseas clinics throughout Africa, Asia and South America, while law students can undertake internships in the Netherlands. The university also has a reciprocal student exchange programme with Fudan University in Shanghai, China.

Around one-third of WashU’s students engage in study abroad programs, 80 per cent of undergraduate students pursue multiple majors and/or minors, and about 60 per cent participate in community service

A total of 26 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with WashU over the years, and its alumni includes 11 Pulitzer Prize winners, four Poet Laureates of the United States and 15 recipients of the National Medal of Science.

The university’s motto, Per Veritatem Vis, translates as ‘Strength through Truth.’"

University of Southern California,=73,United States,"The University of Southern California opened for business in Los Angeles in 1880, when the city still lacked even basic amenities such as paving stones and electric light, and long before it became the glitzy capital of the movie industry. Although spearheaded by a judge called Robert Maclay Widney and a number of like-minded citizens, it took almost 10 years for their plans for a university in the region to come to fruition. It was eventually made possible by the donation of land from a diverse group of philanthropists: a Protestant horticulturist; an Irish pharmacist (and former governor of California); and a German-Jewish banker.

Although it initially welcomed only 53 students, USC has since grown into an internationally renowned research university and the largest private-sector employer in its city. Close to 4,000 faculty are now split between 21 separate schools and units. While the main campus can be found in the centre of Los Angeles, the three teaching hospitals and Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy are grouped together on a separate Health Sciences campus to the north east. Specialisms include cancer, stem cell, regenerative and sports medicine. Equally significant is the city children’s hospital staffed by USC’s Keck School of Medicine.

Physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who postulated the existence of quarks and gave them that name, is one of five Nobel laureates. Home to a School of Cinema Arts since 2011, the university numbers among its alumni many who have gone on to achieve great fame in show business such as Hollywood stars John Wayne and Clint Eastwood and film-maker George Lucas. Equally notable is astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon."

Humboldt University of Berlin,89,Germany,"Established more than 200 years ago, in 1810, the Humboldt University of Berlin is one of the most prestigious universities not only in Germany, but in Europe. It has a world class reputation in arts and humanities fields.

Originally known simply as the University of Berlin, it was given its current name in 1949, and is named after both its founder, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and his brother, the esteemed naturalist and alumnus of the institution, Alexander von Humboldt.

HU Berlin is recognised as one of Europe’s pioneering higher education institutions. Wilhelm von Humboldt is credited with developing a model for universities that saw a closer relationship between research and teaching - a model that is still followed in higher education institutions across the world today.

The institution’s academic clout is evidenced by the fact that it has educated no fewer than 29 Nobel prizewinners, including Max Born, who won the prize for physics in 1954; Theodor Mommsen, who won the prize for for literature in 1902; and Wassily Leontief who won the prize for economics in 1973.

In 2006, the federal government’s German Universities Excellence Initiative began allocating additional funding to institutions that proved they were leaders in science and research. In 2012, HU Berlin, was one of 11 institutions to receive this money, enhancing its reputation as one of the country’s elite universities.

Among HU Berlin’s famous alumni are Marxism founders Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as well as novelist Alfred Döblin, and theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher. Composer Felix Mendelssohn was also a student there, while Albert Einstein spent time as a professor at the university."
University of Copenhagen,90,Denmark,"The University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479, and was made up of four faculties: Theology, Law, Medicine and Philosophy. It is the oldest university in Denmark and the second-oldest in Scandinavia. It is also the largest higher education institution in Denmark. The university has gone through many changes over the years: initially it was an academic republic with its own laws and courts, and it maintained this status until 1771, finally losing its “professional power” in the 1960s.

Today the University of Copenhagen has about 100 departments and research facilities and six faculties – Health and Medical Sciences, Humanities, Law, Science,  Social Sciences and Theology – which offer more than 200 programmes at bachelor’s, master’s and postgraduate degree levels.

Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin,91,Germany,"Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin is one of the largest university hospitals in Europe.

Its motto is: ‘Forschen, Lehren, Heilen, Helfen’, which translates as ‘Research, Teaching, Healing, Helping.’

Dating back to 1710, the hospital was originally built in response to a plague epidemic in Eastern Prussia. By 1727 it had become a military hospital and educational training centre, and renamed Charité.

Following its destruction during World War II, the building had to be rebuilt, and between 1946-1989, it served as a medical institute of the German Democratic Republic.

By 2003, as a result of merges with other medical institutes in Germany, the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin became one of the main medical centres in Europe.

More than half of German Nobel prize-winners in medicine and physiology originated from the Charité, including physician and microbiologist Robert Koch, and the immunologist Paul Ehrlich.

In 2010, the university celebrated its 300-year anniversary and today, it is wholly-owned by the Federal State of Berlin, has a turnover of €1.5 billion per annum and is one of the largest employers in the city, home to 3,700 doctors.

Charité has four campuses across Berlin: Campus Benjamin Franklin, Campus Charité Mitte, Campus Virchow-Klinikum and Campus Berlin Buch, which between them take up 540,000 square meters of land.

It has a student body of 7,000 – 1,200 of whom are from overseas – and is made up of approximately 100 departments and institutes, which are organised into 17 CharitéCentres.

Students of Charité are encouraged to join student councils and committees in order to contribute towards the development of their teaching and learning.

RWTH Aachen University,=92,Germany,"The RWTH Aachen University was founded in 1870 after Prince William of Prussia decided to use a donation to set up an institute of technology somewhere in the Rhine Province. Funding local banks and an insurance company meant that it was eventually located in Aaachen, so building work began in 1865 and doors opened to 223 students during the Franco-Prussian War. There was a strong focus on engineering and particularly the local mining industry.

As Germany’s westernmost important city, Aachen is situated at the heart of Europe and very close to the Dutch and Belgian border, so RWTH Aachen – or Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen – benefits greatly from a mix of cultures and languages. Although faculties of philosophy and medicine were introduced in the 1960s, it is still most famous for natural sciences and engineering – and, since 2014, has joined forces with the city to give a prestigious annual Engineering Award to a prominent figure in the field.

The university has always had strong ties with industry, creating a European equivalent of Silicon Valley around it, and attracted exceptional levels of external funding to its researchers. For its size, Aachen is the dominant German city for university spin-off companies and offices of engineering firms.

The world’s first wind tunnel and particle accelerator were both developed at RWTH Aachen. Major innovations created onsite include a pioneering aircraft made entirely of metal and a diesel soot filter.

In its strategy for 2020, RWTH Aachen makes clear its commitment to interdisciplinary research, which, along with diversity, internationalization and natural sciences, forms one of the four core themes of the work being carried out at its research park. It also aims to be to the top German university of technology and one of the five best in Europe."
University of Bonn,=92,Germany,"The University of Bonn, officially named The Rhenish Friedrich Wilhelm University of Bonn after the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm, was founded in 1818.

Established at the time of the Age of Enlightenment, the university, built on critical thinking and liberal values, expanded rapidly with many eminent scholars attending from across the whole of Germany.

By the 1930s, the Nazis had forced many Jewish intellectuals and dissidents to leave, and the wartime bombardment of Bonn that followed in 1944 led to the university’s destruction. In the post-war period, the university was rebuilt, students returned and its academics set about restoring the institution to its former glory.

Today, the University of Bonn is among the world’s leading research universities. It is home to more than 35,000 students and 4,500 academic staff, with strategic partnerships in place with 70 universities across the globe. Its strong international spirit is evident in its cohort of 4,000 international students, which, at about 12.5% of the student populace, is higher than the national average. Each year it confers approximately 800 PhDs.

The university cites subject strengths in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Economics, Biosciences, and Philosophy. Boasting two Nobel Prize winners: Wolfgang Paul in 1989 for Physics, and Reinhard Selten in 1994 for Economics, it also has associations with eight Leibniz Prize winners. Its most notable alumni include Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the composer Robert Schumann.

The oldest building date on campus dates back to 1859, while others are registered National Historic Landmarks. The Vanderbilt Dyer Observatory is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Though Vanderbilt was intended to be an all-male institution, this was never enforced, and women were admitted from 1875 onwards.

When a fire burnt down the university’s Kirkland Hall in 1905, the schoolchildren of Nashville collected pennies to pay for a replacement bell. That same 2,000-pound bell still chimes in the rebuilt Kirkland Tower, on the hour, every hour.

Vanderbilt has produced four Nobel Laureates in its history, as well as several congressmen, judges, NFL major league baseball players and one Poet Laureate."

There are about 46 acres or 35 football fields of scientific research space on the 600-acre campus, and the university generates over $500 million in research award funds.

Half of the campus is designated as protected green space, some of which is used by the university’s eighteen varsity sports teams.

Emory Healthcare, the largest healthcare system in Georgia, allows students to observe real-world applications for their learning. It makes the university a top destination for medical students, with only one in 50 applicants accepted to the School of Medicine.

There are five secret societies, the oldest being DVS, founded in 1902 in Georgia, which admits seven seniors each year.

Emory counts former President Jimmy Carter, His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta and the US Poet Laureate Natasha Trethewey within its faculty, and numerous famous alumni from the worlds of business, education, entertainment, media, politics and health.

Its alumni includes six Pulitzer Prize winners, a vice president of the United States, a Supreme Court justice, an astronaut, and golf’s only Grand Slam winner.

The spirit of Emory is said to be safeguarded by a lab skeleton of unknown origin named Dooley. Each spring, in a tradition originating in 1899, a week is celebrated in his honour, in which students are secretly selected to don the Dooley cloak and turn up unexpectedly around campus."
Rice University,=103,United States,"Rice University is an intimately sized research university in the heart of Houston, Texas, with a focus on undergraduates and a reputation for unconventional thinking.

Edgar Odell Lovett , the first president of Rice, said “[We must] keep the standards up and the numbers down”, and even today there are only a few thousand students.Lovett introduced a college system whereby students and faculty would live, eat and learn in the same environment.

Over 70% of undergraduates and nearly all first year students live on the 300-acre campus and everybody is a member of one of 11 co-ed colleges. There are no sororities or fraternities and students of different majors and ages live together.

Rice has eight schools of Architecture, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Business, Music, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences, with an undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio of 6 to 1 and a median undergraduate class size of 14.

Since Rice’s inception, exams have not been proctored as students are trusted not to cheat.

Rice’s history dates back to 1891 when businessman William Marsh Rice created a charter for the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, which required that the institute would begin only after his death.

In 1900 he was murdered by his valet, who planned and failed to inherit his estate using a forged will, and in 1912 the institute was born with 77 students, including women, and 12 members of faculty.

Research is not just for faculty members, as over half of the university’s undergraduates also take part, and Rice has been instrumental in the creation of nanotechnology, artificial hearts and Buckyballs.

Rice alumni include several US Congressmen and Cabinet Secretaries, nine astronauts, nine Major League Baseball players, two Nobel Laureates and four fictional literary characters.

The university has a tradition of elaborate practical jokes, the most famous being in 1988 when three engineers, three scientists and an English major developed a successful plan to rotate the university’s 2,000 pound statue of William Marsh Rice by 180 degrees.

Rice’s many wacky rituals include the Beer Bike intramural race and drinking competition dating from the opening of the residential colleges in 1957. However, because of a change in alcohol laws, most students now drink water instead of beer."
Tohoku University,=103,Japan,"For more than a century, Tohoku University has been consistently ranked amongst the top academic institutions in Japan. Its research achievements and contributions, coupled with its wide network of collaborative partners, led to it being one of the first institutions to be conferred the status of a Designated National University by the Japanese government in June 2017.

A trailblazer since its founding in 1907, the university was also the first to accept both women and graduates from technical schools, departing from the norms of other imperial universities at the turn of the 20th century.

Since then, Tohoku University has continued to attract talented researchers who have put their findings towards improving quality of life around the world. Among the inventions that were born at Tohoku University are the split-anode magnetron used in microwave ovens, the steel-wire recorder and the Yagi-Uda antenna.

More recently, in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Tohoku University pioneered research in next-generation medicine and disaster science, giving local and global communities the necessary tools and knowledge to fight illnesses and be better prepared for natural disasters.

Tohoku University’s four main campuses are spread across the cosmopolitan city of Sendai, the cultural, political and economic centre of Japan’s north east (Tohoku) region. Located some 300 kilometers - and a short 90-minute bullet train ride – from Tokyo, Sendai is a city of fascinating contradictions.

Home to a million people, Sendai is a big, sophisticated metropolis with museums and music halls, trendy shops and cafes, with a home team in every major professional sport. But it also has a small-city charm, easy friendliness, four distinct seasons and magnificent nature.

It’s a great place to live and an inspiring place to study. Come join us!

Research Institutions"
Michigan State University,=105,United States,"Michigan State University (MSU) was created in 1855 and was the first of America’s “land-grant” universities  -- institutions handed land to create an environment “where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.”

Today, MSU is one of the largest institutions in the US in terms of enrolment, with over 50,000 students, and is sprawled across a 5,200-acre campus in East Lansing. Its alumni reach is over 540,000 strong, spread all over the world.

MSU is a multi-disciplinary research institution and this is reflected in its diverse range of accolades. Alfred D. Hershey, who took his undergraduate and doctoral degrees at MSU, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969, while one of the world’s greatest ever basketball players Earvin “Magic” Johnson was a keen student at the university before being drafted by the NBA. MSU’s College of Communication Arts and Sciences has a particularly rich history, cultivating eight Pulitzer Prize winners. Richard Ford, another Pulitzer Prize winner for his novelIndependence Day, also studied at MSU.

MSU students are dubbed ‘Spartans’ when they enter the institution and the university’s large sports programme, which has 25 varsity squads."

Ohio State University (Main campus),=108,United States,"Ohio State University was established in 1870 as an agricultural and mechanical college, but with a wide-ranging curriculum that included English and ancient and foreign languages. This legacy has continued to the present day, with the university still offering a broad liberal arts education.

With just 24 students in its initial cohort in 1873, the public university is now one of America’s largest higher education institution. More than 50,000 students study across 15 colleges at its main 1,900-acre campus. Four buildings on campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Hale Hall (originally Enarson Hall), Hayes Hall, Ohio Stadium, and Orton Hall.

The university is renowned for its academic medical centre and cancer hospital and research centre. It also boasts more than 10 museums and galleries, a 60-acre arboretum and a four-acre park dedicated to cancer survivors with sculptures, a walkway and plaques. In 2013-14, the university’s total research expenditure topped $982 million.

Students can also benefit from culture in Columbus, which features a Center of Science and Industry, three historic theatres and a zoo, and hosts a wide range of festivals.

Ohio State University now has more than 500,000 living alumni. Notable former students include pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, businessman Les Wexner, actor Patricia Heaton and writer R. L. Stine.

The university has more than 1,000 student organisations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programmes; student media organisations and publications, fraternities and sororities; and three student governments.The university particularly excels in sports and alumni from Ohio State University have gone on to win 100 Olympic medals (46 gold, 35 silver, and 23 bronze)."
Penn State (Main campus),=108,United States,"Pennsylvania State University is one of the “Public Ivies”: a publicly funded institution that is thought to provide a standard of education comparable to that offered by the elite Ivy League.

Penn State is one of the largest universities in the US.

It runs more than 275 undergraduate degree programmes as well as postgraduate qualifications, while conducting more than $1.44 billion-worth of research every year.

The majority of students are based on the main campus, University Park, located in the centre of the state, but many students begin their studies on another campus before transferring to the main site.

The university has the multi-location Penn State Dickinson Law, as well as the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, which treats more than 1 million patients every year.

The institution also operates Penn State World Campus, allowing students from around the world to study for the university’s qualifications online.

All this is a far cry from Penn State’s humble beginnings in 1855, when it was founded as the Farmers’ High School of Pennsylvania.

The institution gradually diversified its offering but did not gain university status in 1953, a move which was followed by a tripling of student numbers.

The university’s mascot is the Nittany Lion – referring to the mountain lions which are thought to have once roamed nearby Mount Nittany – and alumni take the same name.

Penn State is also home to the world’s largest student-run fundraising event, the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, which sees dancers strut their stuff around the clock over the course of a weekend, raising millions of dollars for charity."
University of Bern,=108,Switzerland,"The University of Bern, based in the Swiss capital, was officially founded in 1834 - although it can trace its roots back to the 16th century, when it became compulsory for monks to be educated in a higher education institution.

It was in the 1800s, however, that the university was officially founded, growing in size throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in line with the city of Bern’s own booming fortunes.

The university played a key role in the evolution of women's studies. Even in 1870, the the institution had a female student -Catharina Gontscharoff - registered. In 1899, the institution’s Female Students' Society was established, representing women's interests. Its motto was: ""Same Rights, Same Duties"".

The university has some prestigious former faculty members. Albert Einstein taught theoretical physics at Bern in 1908, and the following year the Russian philiospher Anna Tumarkin became a professor (and the first European lecturer to accept PhD students).

The University of Bern is not located on a single, main campus. Instead, its faculties and schools are based in the Länggasse area - a district net to the city centre known as the academic part of the town.

The institution has also obtained and repurposed other buildings in the area. Its Faculty of Theology (along with some other faculties), for example, is based in a former chocolate factory. Another former factory known as the vonRoll site is also to be turned into a university building, and will house the Department of Social Sciences.

Famous alumni of the university include philosopher Walter Benjamin, Nobel Prizewinner for chemistry Kurt Wüthrich, and the writer John le Carré."
University of Sheffield,=108,United Kingdom,"Located in the city of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, the University of Sheffield is a public research university, a member of the Russell Group of research-led universities, and one of the UK’s original redbrick universities. It was first established in 1897 when the Sheffield Medical School, Firth College and the Sheffield Technical School joined forces to create the University College of Sheffield. It became the University of Sheffield just 10 years later and founded on the penny donations of Sheffield factory workers who hoped a university would benefit their children, health and local economy. Today the university teaches almost 30,000 students, including over 9,000 international students from 140 countries, and employs approximately 8,000 staff. Its academic departments are divided into five faculties: arts and humanities, engineering, medicine, dentistry and health, science and social sciences. Its motto translates as ""To discover the causes of things"". Sheffield can lay claim to six Nobel Prize winners among its alumni and faculty: Lord Florey for the 1945 Medicine/Physiology Prize, Sir Hans Krebs for the 1953 Medicine/Physiology Prize, Lord Porter for the 1967 Chemistry Prize, Sir Richard Roberts for the 1993 Medicine/Physiology Prize, Sir Harry Kroto for the 1996 Chemistry Prize and Professor Sir Fraser Stoddart for the 2016 Chemistry Prize. Among its alumni are the authors Hilary Mantel and Lee Child, the 2012 Olympic gold-winner Jessica Ennis-Hill, chemist and first Briton in space Helen Sharman, and the first woman to fly solo from Britain to Australia, Amy Johnson. Outside of the university itself, which ranks among the top in the UK for student experience, students at Sheffield can enjoy a thriving, cultural city with a reputation for being inexpensive. The city also benefits from its close proximity to the Peak District, a national park and area of outstanding beauty. It is also within striking distance of other major cities in the North of England, including Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle."
University of Massachusetts,112,United States,"UMass began life in 1863 as the Massachusetts Agricultural College. It took on its current name in 1947. It is the overarching body of the five noted campuses located in Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell and UMass Medical School in Worcester. It is the only public research system in Massachusetts and one of the most highly regarded public university systems in the world. UMass campuses contribute over $6 billion in Massachusetts economic activity annually.

Its flagship campus is at Amherst, the largest institution in the system consisting of around 30,000 of UMass’ more than 73,000 students. UMass Online, which was founded in 2001, gives the system a further presence in the online education world. The consortium features more than 1,500 online courses and 150 online certificate and degree programmes from the five campuses, and there have been just under 70,000 enrolments since its inception.

The system’s faculty is extremely varied and includes Nobel Laureate, Craig Mello at UMass’ medical school, who won the 2006 award for medicine, Pulitzer Prize winning journalism academic Madeleine Blais and former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes, from UMass Amherst, and novelist and National Book Award finalist Andre Dubus III, at UMass Lowell.

Marty Meehan, current president of the UMass system, is also a graduate of one of the campuses, gaining a degree in education and political science at UMass Lowell before serving as the institution’s chancellor from 2007-2015. He is the first UMass undergraduate alumnus to serve as president of the system.

Sport is a major part of the system, with the UMass Minutemen and Minutewomen, the River Hawks, Beacons and Corsairs, representing Amherst, Lowell, Boston and Dartmouth, respectively."
Free University of Berlin,=113,Germany,"The Free University of Berlin was founded in 1948, in the turmoil of post-war Germany, when students of the former Universität Unter den Linden, then located in the Soviet sector of the city, were facing persecution because of their views. With international support, the Free University was established, allowing scholars to pursue their teaching and learning without political interference.

Truth, justice and freedom remain the university’s core values with these words imprinted on the university seal.

In the 1960s, the university was the site of several student protests and demonstrations. In 1990, German reunification brought about changes in the management of the university, and, with it, came a newfound focus on research. Today, it is one of only eleven designated ‘German Universities of Excellence’.

Set in the leafy suburb of Dahlem in southwest Berlin, the university is home to more than 32,000 students and offers over 150 degree programmes. It has 17 collaborative research centres, an academic staff of almost 5,000 and partnerships with universities the world over, as well as seven international liaison offices in Beijing, Brussels, Cairo, Moscow, New Delhi, New York, and Sao Paulo.

The university also boasts five Nobel Prize winners among its staff and 17 winners of the Leibniz Prize. With women employed in 30 per cent of its professorships, the university is also at the forefront of German higher education institutions when it comes to gender representation.

Over the years, the Free University of Berlin has hosted many influential figures, including President John F. Kennedy who chose it as the location to deliver his ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’ speech in 1963."
University of Oslo,=113,Norway,"The University of Oslo (UiO) was established in 1813. It was Norway’s first university, founded when the city after which it is named was still just a provincial town called Christiania. Since then it has made academic breakthroughs in law, science (especially maritime science) and played a key role in Norway's liberation from Denmark.

UiO’s original campus is located in the heart of the city, next to the royal palace and parliament. Its main Blindern campus is a subway ride from there, close to forested hills and offering views of Oslo Fjord.

In 1933, an astronomical observatory was built, still standing to this day, and from 1913-1989 it was home to Norway's national library.

The university constitutes Norway’s largest research institution comprising eight faculties: Theology, Law, Medicine, Humanities, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Dentistry, Social Sciences, and Education. It offers over 800 courses, all taught in English, with 40 Master’s degree programmes also taught in English.

UiO is home to its own museum of cultural history, housing three Viking ships including the best preserved and first ever excavated. Since the university’s founding it has also prided itself on being an 'elite school' for upper secondary school teachers.

Five Nobel Laureates are associated with the university. They include chemist Odd Hassel, economist Ragnar Frisch and Ivar Giæver, an electrical engineer who worked on electron tunnelling and biophysics.

Jens Evensen, a former student of the university and an expert in international law, is responsible for much of Norway's sovereign wealth. He formulated the sentence, ‘The right to subsea natural resources lies with the state,’ which allowed the country to lay claim to the natural resources along its coastline.

Oslo itself is home to 600,000 people, comprising 10% of Norway's entire population. Of the city’s 60,000-strong student population, almost 75 % are from outside Oslo."
Ghent University,115,Belgium,"Ghent University (UGent) in Belgium was founded in 1817 by King William I of Orange. As a Flemish university, most of UGent’s 230 degree programmes are taught in Dutch, although a few of its graduate degrees are offered in English.

With a total of 36,000 students and 9,000 staff, UGent is one of the major research universities in Belgium. Its 11 faculties offer a wide academic portfolio, including courses in every scientific discipline, while its research investment averages around £180million annually.

UGent prides itself on being among the leading universities in the world with a global reputation that attracts talented students and teachers. It boasts associations with several Nobel Prize winners, among them Joseph Guislain, Walter Fiers, Marc Van Montagu and Peter Piot. While its alumni include such notables as Robert Cailliau, who collaborated with Tim Berners-Lee in developing the internet, and the astronaut Dirk Frimout.

The university’s main campus is located close to the city centre. It also has a campus by the sea in Ostend, home to the GreenBridge incubation and innovation center that provides facilities for start-up technology companies, and conducts sustainability research into seas and oceans.

UGent was also the first university in Europe to be accepted as part of the Songdo Global University Campus (SGUC) in Incheon, South Korea, where it provides three bachelor's programmes in molecular biotechnology, environmental technology and food technology to domestic and international students, alongside the 10 other universities it shares a campus with.

Students who live in Ghent can expect to be surrounded by beautiful architecture, unique street art and a large number of pubs, clubs and restaurants.

Good transport links exist throughout the city and Ghent has excellent links to the rest of Belgium by train. Much of Ghent is also navigable by bicycle, which is the most popular mode of transport for students."

The university has close funding and institutional links to the capital – receiving research funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Homeland Security.

It belongs to the Big Ten Conference, one of the oldest collegiate athletic conferences in the United States that includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska. The membership also places the university within the Committee of Institutional Cooperation, an academic consortium of Big Ten universities and the University of Chicago, whose members generated more than $10 billion in research expenditure in 2012.

The 1,250 acre campus, which started out as the 428 acres of an old sugar plantation, has redbrick Georgian buildings, a large central lawn called McKeldin Mall, and enough plants and trees to be designated a botanical garden. Morrill Hall, built in the 1890s, is the oldest structure still in use today.

Almost 40,000 students on one of either 100 undergraduate majors and 120 graduate programmes join a number of notable alumni, including House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, The Muppets creator Jim Henson, The Wire creator David Simon and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.

Nobel prizewinners are also among the staff, with John C. Mather, a Nasa researcher and physics professor, sharing the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006 and Thomas C. Schelling sharing the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2005 – with two more faculty staff and two alumni being awarded in the past century.

The college’s future was not always secured, and indeed the institution went bankrupt from 1864 to 1866 before reopening a year later with 11 students. The first woman earned her bachelor’s degree in 1919, and the first African American student graduated in 1952.

University of Basel,120,Switzerland,"The University of Basel was founded in 1460, making it the oldest university in Switzerland and one of the oldest higher education institutions in the world.

Originally, it was made up of just four faculties - arts, jurisprudence, medicine and theology. Today, it has seven faculties covering a huge range of academic disciplines, and is academic home to tens of thousands of students, including more than 2,500 doctoral candidates.

Basel University Library, meanwhile, contains more than 8 million items. This makes it one of the largest libraries in Switzerland.

In addition to this main library, there are two more specialised collections: the University Medical Library and the University Business and Economics Library/Swiss Economics Archive.

The university has experienced mixed fortunes during its 550 year history, and at one point in the 18th century had just 60 students enrolled. Around this time, there were discussions about dissolving the university altogether.

The institution rallied, however, and in the 20th century, despite the challenges of two world wars, it grew in size and strength.

In 1997, the University of Basel opened the University of Seniors, offering higher education to older people. It followed this in 2004 by establishing the Children’s University for eight to 12-year-olds, designed to introduce these youngsters to the world of science and give them a behind-the-scenes look at a modern university.

The university campus is located in the heart of the city centre, near to the River Basel.

Notable alumni of the University of Basel include the German scientist William Theilheimer, Swiss author and psychologist Alice Miller, the founder of analytical psychology Carl Gustav Jung, and the biochemist Emil Abderhalden."

Ørsted, the father of electromagnetism, and its graduates played a major role in the rise of Danish engineering. It is now bills itself as one of the leading engineering universities in Europe, and teaches the subject at bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral levels.

Research at the university focuses on the physical sciences – including chemistry, biotechnology and physics – as well as on certain industries such as agriculture, management, transport and construction. The university says it is particularly focused on “usefulness to society, relevance to business, and sustainability”.

When it comes to studying, the “Scandinavian way” pervades how students are taught, the university says. Students are encouraged take responsibility for their projects, and there is also a “refreshing lack of hierarchy” and relatively informal relationships between academics and students. Professors are known by their first names, as in Denmark, respect is earned, rather than coming from wealth, job or car size. But don’t be late – even a delay of a few minutes is considered “quite rude”, according to the institution.

The university’s main campus is at Lyngby, around 15 km north of Copenhagen. It was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s when it needed more space, and now boasts more than 100 buildings. The campus was designed by a famous Danish architect couple, Eva and Nils Koppel. There are also other university outposts in Ballerup, northwest of Copenhagen, and at Risø, which sits on one of Denmark’s fjords and specialises in finding sustainable energy solutions."
University of Göttingen,=122,Germany,"Regarded as one of the most prestigious universities in Germany, the University of Göttingen is located in the historic Saxon town of the same name, in the centre of Germany.

Established in 1737, the university – informally known as Georgia Augusta – is home to about 26,000 students, 11% of who are international.

A research-led university, Göttingen has associations with over 40 Nobel Prize winners, including physicists Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck and Otto Stern. The Brothers Grimm both taught at Göttingen and its alumni includes the statesman Otto von Bismarck, philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, poet Heinrich Heine and sociologist Max Weber.

Napoleon once said of Göttingen that it belonged ‘to the whole of Europe.' It was founded by England's King George II in his capacity as Elector of Hanover, and the university’s library, founded in 1734, was the first comprehensive academic library of European standing.

In the first part of the twentieth century, Göttingen was regarded as the centre of the mathematical world – a position it lost in 1933 when more than 50 of its faculty were forced to leave the University under Nazi rule.

After World War II, Göttingen was the first university in Germany to resume teaching, going on to become one the largest higher education institutions in the country.

The modern Göttingen offers a wide range of degree programmes, particularly in the humanities, with almost all academic disciplines represented across its 13 faculties. It prioritises creativity, in particular, with students and faculty encouraged to engage in creative thinking as well as acquiring methodological knowledge.

The university’s profile is further enhanced by its partnerships with several local research partners, including the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, the German Aerospace Centre and five Max Planck Institutes, which work with the university to provide an alliance of collaboration in research and teaching.

Göttingen is itself a hub of culture and creativity, hosting many events and festivals throughout the year including the international Handel Festival, which celebrates German baroque music."

The relevant legislation was known as the Buckman Act and its originator, Henry Holland Buckman, is honoured in the university’s Buckman Hall.

Major developments soon followed. In 1906, the Florida Museum of Natural History was incorporated into UF. As well as being invaluable for teaching and research, this represented a commitment to the study of biological diversity still significant almost a century later in 2000, when the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity was established as one of the largest collections of butterflies and moths in the world. In 1909, president Albert Murphree reorganised the separate colleges under a single mission and greatly expanded the size of the institution, with an annual intake rising from 200 to over 2,000.

Major developments in the 20th century include the creation of the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing in 1956 and a teaching hospital two years later. By building on these, UF is now the only university in the country which incorporates six different healthcare colleges on a single campus. A different landmark was reached in 1968, when the first ever “Gator” took part in the Olympics.

Since the millennium, the university has remained at the forefront of research in many areas, often through high-profile international collaborations. In 2002, it led a consortium of seven universities which secured a $15 million grant from NASA to carry out space research. From 2008, a partnership with Zhejiang University in China worked on sustainable energy. In 2012, over 30 UF physicists, postdocs and students played a leading part in the team whose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider established that the elusive Higgs boson really existed. The university continues to work with Spain on the world’s largest single-aperture optical telescope.

In 2014, the total number of students who had graduated from UF reached half a million. Notable alumni include actress Faye Dunaway, astronaut Kevin Ford and senior senator of Florida Marco Rubio."

University of Arizona,=138,United States,"Predating the state from which it takes its name, the University of Arizona is a leading research institution located in the city of Tucson.

Funding for the university was allocated in 1885 – when Arizona was just a territory of the US, not a full state – in a step that was regarded as a poor deal by Tucson’s residents, who had hoped to receive the more lucrative appropriation to build a mental hospital instead.

Amid this reluctance, finding land for the university was a challenge, until two professional gamblers and a saloon keeper were persuaded to donate a patch of desert; allowing construction to begin in 1887, and classes to begin in 1891.

Since then, the university has expanded to cover more than 380 acres of central Tucson, with much of the campus having been designated as an arboretum because of the rare trees that it holds. Almost all of the university’s buildings are characterised by the use of red bricks, particularly in facades.

The university is divided into a number of colleges, and boasts two medical schools, as well as the Banner-University Medical Center, which is rated as one of the best hospitals in the US.

Among the colleges is the University of Arizona Honors College, which aims to provide an experience similar to a liberal arts college, with more than 4,500 students.

The university is home to seven libraries and nine museums, including the Arizona State Museum and Biosphere 2, described as a “world under glass”, holding a living rainforest and an “ocean” in glass domes.

The university is renowned for its research impact, and a particular research strength is space science, with the institution claiming to have been awarded more Nasa grants than any other university in the US.

Overall, the university receives more than $580 million (£402 million) in research funding every year. In turn, through knowledge transfer and technology parks, the university estimates that it supports $8.3 billion of economic activity in Arizona every year.

Sports teams and alumni of the university are known as “Wildcats”, and the institution’s motto is “Bear Down, Arizona” – the last words of revered American football quarterback John “Button” Salmon, in 1926.

Notable alumni of the university include late US presidential candidate Barry Goldwater,Sesame Streetco-creator Joan Ganz Cooney, and Nobel prizewinning astrophysicist Brian Schmidt.

Alumni who have made a career in entertainment include actor Greg Kinnear, actress Kristen Wiig and reality television star Kourtney Kardashian."
University of Freiburg,=138,Germany,"Despite being founded more than 550 years ago, the University of Freiburg is only the fifth oldest university in Germany.

Nonetheless, its long history teaching across sciences and humanities subjects has earned its reputation as one of Germany’s elite universities worldwide.

The student population includes 120 different nationalities, with international students making up around 16 per cent of the total number of students.

Many famous intellectuals, scientists and cultural figures attended or taught at the university, including physicist Martin Heidegger, philosophers Hannah Arendt and Rudolf Carnap and biologist Paul Uhlenhurth.

Tongji University,=141,China,"Tongji University, one of China’s earliest national key universities, is a prestigious institution of higher education that is directly under the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is supported by the Shanghai Municipality. Already in its second centenary, the University has grown into a comprehensive and research-intensive university with distinctive features and an international reputation. The University was among the 36 Class A universities in the list of Double First Class University Plan released by the central government of China in 2017. According to 2019 Global Universities Rankings by US News & World Report, Tongji University ranks 11th in the Country Rank of China and 35th in Best Global Universities in Asia.

The history of Tongji can be traced back to 1907, when the German Medical School was founded by Erich Paulun, a German doctor, and was then renamed as Tongji German Medical School in the following year. The School was expanded later to include engineering in its programs and got its new name of Tongji German Medical and Engineering School in 1912. In 1917, it was taken over by ethnic Chinese, and then successively given the name of Tongji Medical and Engineering School, and Private Tongji Medical and Engineering Specialist School. In 1923, it was formally established as Tongji University and was later renamed as National Tongji University in 1927. After the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression broke out in 1937, the University campus moved six times, first from Shanghai to Zhejiang Province, and then to Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Yunnan Provinces, and finally to LizhuangVillagein Yibin, Sichuan Province in 1940. It was eventually moved back to Shanghai in 1946. It then grew to be a comprehensive university that offered programs in science, engineering, medicine, arts, and law.

Following a nationwide campaign of reorganizing schools and departments among universities launched by the central government of the newly founded People’s Republic of China in 1949, the original predominant disciplines, including art, law, medicine, science, machinery, motor, shipbuilding, surveying, and mapping, were moved to support other universities or relocated entirely in the mainland. At the same time, the disciplines related to engineering converged at Tongji University from more than 10 universities, making it a university with the largest scale and the most complete disciplines in engineering, especially in civil engineering. Since 1978, “two transformations” were launched, namely, the transforming to an international university by restoring links to Germany, and the transforming from a university focusing mainly on civil engineering to a multi-disciplinary engineering university. In 1996, Tongjiwasmerged with the Shanghai Institute of Urban Construction and Shanghai Institute of Building Materials and was listed later in Project 211. In 2000, the expanded Tongji has merged again with Shanghai Tiedao University and developed into the new Tongji. Then, in 2002, it was listed in Project 985 and took over the administration of the Shanghai College of Aviation Industry in 2003.

The University has always placed nurturing talents of the highest quality as its fundamental responsibility. The three-dimensional KAP educational principles of “Knowledge, Ability, and Personality” are deeply rooted in the undergraduate education and reinforced at the graduate level of education, aiming to ensure that every student has “a solid foundation, practical ability, creativity, global vision, and a sense of social responsibility” in order to become “the top talent who will lead sustainable development and act as the backbone of society.” Among over 300,000 graduates of the University since its founding, many are extraordinary political leaders, scientists, educators, social activists, business leaders, medical specialists, and engineering experts. Over 150 alumni are members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

Aiming to grow with China and serve the world with science and technology, the University has long focused on unleashing the spillover effect of its flagship disciplines for the greater public good, and actively contributing to the economic and social development at the national and regional level. So far, the University has provided strong technical support to some significant national strategies, including but not restricted to the Belt and Road Initiative, the fields of bridges and tunnels, railway and urban traffic, urban sewage treatment, earthquake relief work, Yangshan Port, World Expo 2010 Shanghai, the Chongming Eco-island Plan. The economic development initiative around Tongji Campus launched jointly by the local government and Tongji proved a tremendous success, with the annual GDP reaching a record high of USD 600 million in 2018.

The University has always taken an active role in expanding international cooperation. With close historical ties with Germany, it partners mainly with European universities but is also actively expanding its influence to North America, Asia, and Africa. So far, it has established 11 international cooperation platforms in partnership with Germany, France, Italy, Finland, Spain, and United Nations agencies. The University has also signed a memorandum of understanding with over 200 international universities and co-founded research centers with Volkswagen, Siemens, Bayer, IBM, and many other multinational enterprises. The University initiated the “China Green University Network (CGUN)” and the “International Green Campus Alliance (IGCA)”, and acted as the first President. It was also elected as the League President of Global Universities Partnership on Environment for Sustainability (GUPES) under the United Nations Environment Programme and became the first Asian university to win the “Excellence in Campus Award” at the meeting organized by International Sustainable Campus Network.

University of St Andrews,=162,United Kingdom,"The University of St Andrews was Scotland’s first university and only the third to be founded in the English-speaking world. It sits in the heart of the east coast town of the same name, in the Kingdom of Fife.

At a time when university status could only be conferred by the Pope, the then Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw, sought a blessing from Pope Benedict XIII to establish a national university (most Scottish students in the middle ages were forced out of Oxford and Cambridge as a result of the Wars of Independence with England).

The papal blessing was granted in 1413, allowing the St Andrews school of higher studies, on the site of a former monastery, the authority to confer degrees.

Over 900 degree courses are now offered at the university, organised across four faculties: Arts, Divinity, Medicine, and Science.

About a third of its 8,000 students come from Scotland while just under half are international, hailing from 120 different countries in total, and the university has some of the lowest drop-out rates in the country.

In 1892, the institution accepted its first women students, at a time when the majority of British universities still did not.

The town of St Andrews is small – just 17,000 permanent residents live among protected conservation areas, meaning university staff along with 7,500 students makes up about half its population. The university itself refers to the ‘thee people rule’. Supposedly a student walking down the street in St Andrews is bound to know at least one in every three people they pass.

The institution even has its own wind farm, making St Andrews self-sufficient for electrical energy.

Prominent St Andrew’s alumni include politician Alex Salmond, the inventor of logarithms John Napier, Prince William Duke of Cambridge and Catherine (née Middleton) Duchess of Cambridge."

The Jefferson Literary and Debating Society, dating back to 1825, is the oldest continuously debating student society in the US and continues to meet at 7.29pm every Friday in Jefferson Hall, as it always has.

When Jefferson was designing the university, he placed a library, not a chapel (as was customary), at the centre of the institution to indicate a commitment to the pursuit of knowledge. In 1815, the newly-formed Library of Congress acquired Jefferson’s personal collection of 6,487 books on philosophy, science and literature.

The library still plays a central role in the life of the university, offering five million print volumes of books, 16 million manuscripts and home to a vast digital archive that works to preserve physical works, such as the Jefferson Papers, as well as rare video from the Civil Rights Era.

The University of Virginia has produced eight NASA astronauts, eight Pulitzer Prize winners and 51 Rhodes Scholars – the most from any state-supported university and the most in America’s South.

Sapienza University of Rome,=170,Italy,"The Sapienza University of Rome, originally named Studium Urbis, was founded in 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII, making it Rome’s oldest university. Its motto ‘Il futuro è passato qui’ translates as ‘the future was here.’

After relocating to a new building in 1660, the university began to be known as Sapienza because of the inscription on its main gate, which read ‘Initium Sapientiae Timor Domini’ (the beginning of wisdom is the feat of the Lord). Sapienza is situated in the very centre of Rome, within walking distance of the main rail station, Termini.

Sapienza is the largest university in Europe, supporting over 115,000 students, including 5,500 international students, and almost 4,000 academic staff. It offers 250 degree programmes and 200 specialist courses across 63 departments, with 59 libraries available for student use (the largest number of any Italian university) as well as 21 museums.

Through the Erasmus exchange programme, Sapienza is partnered with at least 400 other universities, and maintains a strong international presence.

The university’s tuition fees are relatively low compared to most European universities and its School for Advanced Studies extends training in specific courses every year to gifted high school students alongside free accommodation and tuition.

Sapienza also offers subsidised tuition fees for students from developing countries and provides financial support for enterprises designed to improve academic and student movement to and from developing countries.

University of Antwerp,=170,Belgium,"The roots of the University of Antwerp (UA) date back to 1852 with the establishment of the State School for Economics and the Saint Ignatius School of Economics – two commercial institutes with a focus on business.

Both institutes were granted university status by the Belgian government in the 1960s and became Faculties for Economic Science. The Jesuit Saint Ignatius School gradually expanded to offer courses in arts, law and social sciences and by the 1970s, a third institute was founded to provide post-graduate and PhD programmes in Belgium’s second largest city.

All three institutions began operating as a confederation under the University of Antwerp banner and finally became the university it is today in 2003.

Today, UA is home to 20,000 students, of which about 18 per cent come from overseas with 132 countries represented through the student body. Working at the university are over 5,000 employees, including 3,000 tenured researchers and almost 700 professors.

The university is organised across nine faculties, including Economics, Engineering, Arts, Design Sciences, Law, Medicine, Pharmaceutical, Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, and Social Sciences.

It offers 33 undergraduate degree programmes, 69 master’s and 18 ‘master-after-master programmes’. A total of 31 programmes are taught in English and the university prides itself on engendering an entrepreneurial approach.

There are nine campuses of the university that are spread throughout the diverse city of Antwerp, from the historic city centre to what is called the ‘green belt’ to the south.

Each year, the university publishes around 3,650 scientific publications. It cites research strengths in drug discovery and development, ecology and sustainable development, infectious diseases, neurosciences, socio-economic policy, and urban history and policy."

TU Dresden,174,Germany,"The Technische Universität Dresden (TUD) is a public university located in the German city of Dresden, near the country's eastern border with the Czech Republic.

The university’s origins can be traced as far back as 1828, when it was founded as the Royal Saxon Technical School.

Today, TUD is a modern, multidisciplinary university and one of the biggest technical universities in Germany.

With the motto Wissen schafft Brücken – ‘Knowledge builds bridges’ – the university boasts 14 faculties in five different schools. It is home to more than 100 different disciplines, ranging from natural and engineering sciences, to humanities, social sciences and medicine.

The buildings on the university’s main campus, just south of Dresden’s city centre, date from three distinct periods. The architect Martin Dülfer designed the earliest buildings while, following the destruction of Dresden in Allied bombing raids, Hermann Glöckner did much to contribute to the university’s restoration. The modern era buildings on campus, dating from 1990, were built following reunification of the country.

TUD comprises 14 faculties and offers 125 degree programmes across a wide range of disciplines, with a research focus on Biomedicine, Bioengineering, Materials sciences, Information technology, Microelectronics, Energy and the Environment.

The university is one of eleven institutions in the country to be classified as a ‘University of Excellence’ in the German Universities Excellence Initiative. It is also a member of TU9, an association of the nine leading German Institutions of Technology.

Of the 36,000 students who attend TUD, around 40% are from the Saxony area (of which Dresden is the capital), about 20% are from other former East German federal states, and approximately 13% are from overseas, mainly Europe and Asia. The remainder of students come from former West German federal states.

Dresden itself, largely rebuilt after World War II, is considered one of the most beautiful cities in Germany. Situated on the River Elbe and known as the Jewel Box because of its baroque and rococo architecture, many of its historical buildings were restored to their former glory in the post-war years."

Georgetown University,201–250,United States,"Georgetown University, a private university in Washington DC, is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit higher education institution in the US.

Its alumni include two former US presidents: Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson; as well as several other heads of state, including King Felipe VI of Spain.

Having been founded in 1789 by John Carroll, the US’ first bishop and archbishop, on a hilltop overlooking the Potomac River, Georgetown awarded its first bachelor’s degrees in 1817.

The American Civil War nearly forced the closure of the university, with the student body dropping from 313 to 17 between 1859 and 1861, but it was in the aftermath of the conflict that Georgetown became the institution that is known today.

Patrick Healy, the university’s president between 1873 and 1882 and the first African American to earn a PhD, reshaped the institution’s curriculum to place a focus on history and the natural sciences, and started the construction of Healy Hall, the flagship Flemish Romanesque building at the heart of the campus.

Nowadays the university is divided into nine undergraduate and graduate schools, including Georgetown College, which offers a liberal arts programme, and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, which has educated heads of state and politicians from around the world.

With more than 7,000 undergraduate and about 10,000 postgraduate students, about 11 per cent of Georgetown’s students are from overseas, being drawn from about 130 countries.

Although it has always been independent of the Catholic Church, Georgetown’s Jesuit heritage continues to be influential, with education at the university emphasising service to others, particularly the vulnerable and disadvantaged.

Georgetown also runs a school of foreign service in Doha, Qatar, and offers study abroad opportunities at villas around the Mediterranean.

Alumni and sports teams of Georgetown are known as Hoyas. Prominent Hoyas include US defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld; José Manuel Barroso, the former president of the European Commission; and King Abdullah II of Jordan. Actor Bradley Cooper is another Georgetown alumnus."
George Washington University,201–250,United States,"Founded in 1821 by an Act of Congress, George Washington University says that it “makes history”. It was George Washington himself who envisioned a university in the United States capital in his last will and testament, to serve as an intellectual hub for the entire country.

It boasts three campuses – Foggy Bottom, Mount Vernon and the Virginia Science and Technology campus – so close to the heart of power that parts of the university are just a four-block walk to the White House, not to mention many other governmental and private agencies, providing huge internship and job opportunities for students.

The university’s graduates have helped shape US history: it counts five Supreme Court justices among its alumni. Politicians Colin Powell and John Foster Dulles, as well as former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and former first lady Jackie Kennedy also went to George Washington.

George Washington was the backdrop to several momentous events in 20th-century history. In 1939, a conference on campus revealed that Otto Hahn had successfully split the atom; while in 1981, the university hospital treated Ronald Reagan after an attempted assassination.

But the university is not just about politics. George Washington boasts a thriving arts scene, with several student dance groups, improvisation and theatre clubs, art galleries, as well as instrumental and voice ensembles.

The university’s Lisner Auditorium has hosted appearances ranging from Betty White and Al Gore to Salman Rushdie. It has a wide range of fine art, music, theatre and dance scholarships on offer to freshmen.

Based in Washington, students have access to some of the finest libraries, museums and arts venues in the country. It also has a strong athletic tradition, stretching back to the late 19th century.

The university launched collegiate basketball in 1906, just as the sport was in its infancy. George Washington also has an impressive record in soccer, baseball and athletics.

There are no fewer than six busts of George Washington himself on campus, and the university colours of buff and blue are those the general wore into battle.

It has two mascots: an official namesake mascot called George, completed with powdered wig and tricorne hat; and an unofficial hippo mascot, which appears around campus and at events."
Goethe University Frankfurt,201–250,Germany,"Goethe University in Frankfurt is named after the preeminent figure in German literature and most celebrated son of Frankfurt, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who also made a major contribution to the sciences. It was inspired by his Enlightenment ideals and originally established as a “citizens’ university” with financial support from private sources, but now enjoys a funding model highly unusual within German higher education.

This gives it a significant level of state funding combined with freedom to build its own endowment. (When it celebrated its centenary in 2014, over 70 million Euros were donated to the university.) This has led to almost complete autonomy in administrative and academic matters such as the appointment of staff.

A relatively small city with a wide range of cultural attraction, Frankfurt has an enviable reputation for its quality of life and, as the leading financial centre in Europe, also has an extremely international outlook and population. These are very much assets for Goethe University too, which is committed to global partnerships, offering its students the chance to spend time abroad and bringing in foreign scholars as part of its “international campus” initiative.

The university is currently based on four separate campuses, each with it their own distinctive flavour. The medical school and hospital, for example, are located at Niederrad, on the banks of the river Main, close to many of Frankfurt’s main museums. The new Westend Campus is even more attractive, with the latest teaching and leisure facilities set in a park environment and a range of buildings faced in travertine stone.

A world-class research university with a strong commitment to interdisciplinary approaches, Goethe University is particularly well regarded for its work in medicine and physics as well as highly applicable contributions to economics and business administration."

Medical University of Graz,201–250,Austria,"The Medical University of Graz in Austria had its beginnings in 1863, when Emperor Franz Josef founded the faculty of medicine at the Karl Franzens-University of Graz.

However, it was not until 2004 that the faculty became an independent university, opening as the Centre for Medical Research with a library and Learning Centre. At the same time, a Nursing Science programme was launched.

The university was an early supporter of female doctors, admitting women since 1900. Seven years later, Dr Octavia Auguste Aigner-Rollett, graduate of the University, became the first woman to open a practice in Graz. Today, the university has a Laura Bassi Centre of Expertise, part of a Europe-wide series of such research centres which are lead by top-level female scientists.

Medical University of Innsbruck,201–250,Austria,"The Medizinische Universität Innsbruck (Medical University of Innsbruck) has roots that go back long before the foundations of the establishment were laid.

It began as one of the first hospitals in the nearby silver-mining city of Schwaz in 1307, then a medical faculty was added to the initial university, which was set up by Emperor Leopold I in 1669.

It was one of the four faculties of the Leopold-Franzens-Universitat Innsbruck (philosophy was established in 1669, law in 1670, theology in 1670 and medicine in 1674) but gained its independence in 2004.

It is now one of the largest educational facilities for doctors and medical researchers in western Austria.

University of Aberdeen,201–250,United Kingdom,"The University of Aberdeen is Scotland’s third oldest university, and the UK’s fifth. It was formed in the merging of two colleges, King’s and Marischal, in 1860.

King’s College was founded in 1495 by William Elphinstone, the then Bishop of Aberdeen, who used the great European universities of Paris and Bologna as his model.

With just 36 staff and students when it first opened, King’s was dedicated to training teachers, doctors, lawyers and the clergy who would serve northern Scotland and the Scottish monarchy. It offered studies in arts, theology and the law, and its position of chair of medicine, established in 1497, was the first to be created in the English-speaking world.

Marischal College meanwhile was opened in 1593, in the New Town of Aberdeen, by the fourth Earl Marischal.

The two colleges merged and for a time King’s focused on arts and divinity while Marischal focused on law and medicine.

The first women were admitted as students in 1894, with four women graduating in arts in 1898. By 1899, women were a quarter of their faculty.

Current students of the university number around 14,000 and prominent alumni include former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, former Cabinet Office Minister Tessa Jowell, two judges of the supreme court of Scotland and a number of university vice-chancellors.

The university is embedded in a vibrant ecosystem of cutting-edge non-university research institutes, e.g.  the Max Planck society, the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, the Helmholtz Association or the Leibniz Association, as well as leading international companies, such as Adidas, Bosch, Schaeffler and Siemens. The results are partnerships which benefit students as well as researchers, allowing them to look beyond the threshold of university life and expand their network.

Applied research at FAU also benefits innovative startups, as the university is the founder and largest partner of one of the most successful tech incubators in Germany, Zollhof, in the center of Nuremberg.

Notabilities

FAU has brought forth several well-known figures over the past centuries who have either done research or studied at the university. These include Nobel Prize winner Hermann Emil Fischer, the father of classical organic chemistry; Emmy Noether, one of the founders of modern algebra and FAU’s first female full-time student; Dixie Lee Bryant, the first woman to receive a doctoral degree at FAU in 1904; Ludwig Erhard, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany from 1963 to 1966; Prof. Dr. Harald zur Hausen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008 for his research on the human papilloma virus; Dr. Heike Riel who was listed as one of the Top 100 early career scientists by MIT Technology Review in 2003 and is currently Executive Director of the IBM Research Frontiers Institute as well as the Director of IoT Technology and Solutions at IBM Research; and Markus Söder, the current Bavarian Minister President."
University of Gothenburg,201–250,Sweden,"With the help of private donations, Gothenburg University College, as it was then known, was established in 1891, becoming the University of Gothenburg in 1954. It is the third oldest of Sweden’s universities.

Around the middle of the last century, the institution began to grow exponentially, expanding  from just 500 students in the 1940s to around 27,000 today.

The majority of its campus buildings are based in the centre of Gothenburg, Sweden’s second-largest city, where there is a thriving café culture. The university’s main building, built in 1907 and located in the Vasaparken, is considered a historic gem, and is protected by Sweden’s National Heritage Board.

The university has more than 6,000 employees, 58 per cent of whom are women. Within its nine faculties there are 38 departments.

The university’s strong research reputation attracts scientists and students from all around the world. To build on this, Gothenburg plans to establish six research centres aimed at solving “current global societal challenges” through “strong interdisciplinary research”. These will consist of the Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research, the Centre for Collective Action Research, the Centre for Ageing and Health, the Centre for Critical Heritage Studies, the Centre for Future Chemical Risk Assessment and Management Strategies and the Swedish Mariculture Research Centre.

Gothenburg also takes its environmental responsibilities seriously, and was the first university in the world to be environmentally certified according to ISO 14001 (the international standard for environmental management systems) and registered with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.

Notable alumni include author Jonas Jonasson and Nobel prizewinner Arvid Carlsson."
University of Illinois Chicago,201–250,United States,"The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) is the city’s only public research university. It grew out of the Chicago College of Pharmacy, founded in 1859, after which it joined forces with other medical colleges in the region.

Although UIC’s origins are rooted in healthcare – the university lays claim to the largest medical school in the US – its 15 colleges offer programmes spanning liberal arts, social work and engineering, as well as sciences and health.

The institution now comprises over 29,000 students and is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse student bodies in America.

UIC’s first campus, at the junction of the Greektown and Little Italy districts of Chicago, meant that many students were the first in their families to attend college (and still remain so, to this day).

During a period of rapid student expansion in the 1960s, the renowned Chicago architect Walter Netsch was asked to design buildings that would accommodate a growing student community in what was a small area of land. His response was to construct them in a series of concentric rings, the inspiration for which was a droplet of water.

Netsch’s brutalist style dominates UIC’s east campus, which is nicknamed ‘Circle’ after the major expressway that runs alongside it.

Extra-curricular activities at UIC are in plentiful supply. Sports facilities include a gym, volleyball and racquetball courts, running paths, climbing walls and an outdoor field complex comprising 214,000 square feet of synthetic turf for soccer and baseball games. A separate outdoor facility has tennis and basketball courts, along with swimming pools, saunas and a wellness centre.

At the beginning of each academic year, UIC also hosts a free ‘back to school’ music festival on campus exclusively for students. A 10,000-seater, multi-purpose arena on campus allows for easy access to other major concerts and productions, while a contemporary art space, called Gallery 400, is at the centre of the Chicago arts scene.

Away from campus, UIC students have the opportunity to take part in one of the university’s many study abroad programmes that include, among other things, interning at the German Bundestag and working for a member of the German Parliament."
University of Malaya,201–250,Malaysia,"The University of Malaya, a public research university in Kuala Lumpur, is Malaysia’s oldest university, founded in 1905.

Originally known as the King Edward VII College of Medicine, it was created to solve a shortage of medical assistants in Singapore and Penang during the late 1890s. It was then housed in the old asylum near the Singapore General Hospital.

In 1949 the university merged with Raffles College, a school established in 1929 by the English for Malayans to study arts and social sciences, to become the University of Malaya, derived from the country’s name at the time.

In 1960, the government decided that, due to its rapid growth, the university would be divided into two national universities, one in Singapore (now an autonomous separate university known as the National University of Singapore), and the other in Kuala Lumpur (established as its own institution in 1962, still retaining its name as the University of Malaya).

The university’s Coat of Arms shows the leaves of the Palmyra palm, which were used as printing material for ancient Malay books. Across these is written the university’s motto, ‘Ilmu Puncha Kemajuan’, a mixture of words from Arabi, Sanskrit and Malay, which means ""knowledge is the source of progress"". In the centre are three Malayan tigers, symbolising the three main races in Malaysia: Malays, Chinese and Indians.

Today the campus is located 12km from the centre of Kuala Lumpur, on 920 acres, which include an Olympic sized swimming pool and a lake with kayaking. It has been granted self-accreditation since 2009, and has more than 60 research centres with six research clusters.

Notable alumni include two prime ministers of Malaysia, as well as many politicians and other prominent figures from Malaysia and abroad."
University of Mannheim,201–250,Germany,"The University of Mannheim is one of Germany’s leading research universities with a particular emphasis on the social and economic sciences. Founded in 1907, Mannheim’s first School of Commerce quickly grew into a thriving higher education institution.

In 1933, the School was merged with the University of Heidelberg and the institution went through a series of identities before officially designated a university in 1967.

With the majority of its campus housed in and around the Mannheim Baroque Palace – the largest of its kind in the country – it is frequently described by international students as being the most beautiful university campus in Germany. Consequently, its 12,000 students and 3,000 staff have the luxury of working in an inspiring atmosphere.

Mannheim’s mission is to give students and faculty a blended experience of teaching and research, thereby ensuring its international competitiveness in global higher education. All academic programmes are interwoven with the basics of business administration.

The university’s profile is further shaped by its excellence in economic and social sciences, with its triple-accredited business school making the university one of the few German and global institutions to have achieved this status.

Given its impressive academic credentials, Mannheim has educated and employed some of Germany’s leading scholars, including numerous Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners. Hans-Werner Sinn, president emeritus at Ifo Institute – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, and Clemens Fuest, current president of the Ifo Institute, respectively were educated at and taught at Mannheim.

A very student and civic-focused institution, Mannheim organises the annual Schlossfest, where venues in and outside the Mannheim Palace provide new and current students, and members of the public, with a diverse mix of music, cultural performances, parties, guided tours, academic lectures and lounge areas."

The first building, today called the Merrick Building after George Merrick who gave the college $5 million in its first year, was left unfinished for more than two decades because of economic difficulties – with classes run instead at a nearby hotel, giving the university the early nickname of “Cardboard College”. Today, however, an endowment of about $2.58 billion in revenue, which came to the university during the fiscal year 2014, has seen it expand and consolidate its estate.

Miami has 12 colleges and schools on different campuses, including the Miami School of Law on the 260 acre main campus, the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine (which trains at least 1,000 students in health-related programmes), and a school focused on the study of oceanography and atmospheric sciences.

The main campus is in Coral Gables, south of Miami, and includes a theatre, arboretum and architecture centre. A large pool named “Lake Osceola” with a large fountain in the centre of the main campus serves as a focal point for the university.

First founded by citizens during the Jim Crow era as a white, coeducational institution, it became the first major college in the South with a black football player on scholarship in 1966.

Some 16,000 students enrolled in 2014, at about a 40 per cent acceptance rate. Notable alumni include wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, actor Sylvester Stallone and singer Gloria Estefan. Former president Donna E. Shalala led the University of Miami between 2001 and 2016 and served under President Bill Clinton as the longest-serving US Secretary of Health and Human Services."

Vrije Universiteit Brussel,201–250,Belgium,"The Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) in Belgium is an institution founded on the principles of free enquiry and an adherence to reason. The seal of the university is embroidered with the Latin Scientia Vincere Tenebras, meaning ‘science will conquer the darkness.’

The university grew out of the French-speaking Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) until the two institutions separated in 1969, with the Dutch-speaking VUB becoming fully independent in 1970.

The principles of free enquiry the university is established on are ones that its founder, Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen, held close to his heart. As a lawyer and politician, Verhaegen wanted to create a place of great learning that would be disconnected from the stifling aspects of the church and state and, in 1834, he achieved this with the inception of the ULB.

Verhaegen’s legacy survives and every year he is commemorated at both universities through the laying of wreaths at his memorial. The VUB and its sister institution the ULB remain closely affiliated, helped by their proximity to each other in Brussels.

The university is organised across two campuses in the centre of Brussels: Etterbeek, its main campus, and a medical campus at Jette. It is the biggest Dutch-speaking employer in the area, located close to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, the Royal Palace of Brussels and other major attractions and places of historical interest.

VUB prides itself on having an open-door policy and a highly democratic spirit, where everyone at the university, from students to professors, are given a say in the management of the institution.

The main 1km2 campus is situated in the centre of Zhongguancun Science Park, also known as ‘China’s Silicon Valley’, just by the Olympic Centre and within easy reach of central Beijing. The second campus, Shahe, of a similar size in a rural setting 20km away, is home to the National Laboratory of Aeronautics and Astronautics

As part of China’s Project 211 and Project 985, which aim to improve the standards of the top 100 and 40 Chinese universities respectively, it has a heavy focus on high level technological and scientific research. As the first university in China to focus on aeronautical and astronautical education and research, it has long been dedicated to contributing new knowledge to the field, to further China’s aerospace ambitions.

Today it has developed into a comprehensive research university with departments of engineering, natural sciences, humanities and social sciences.

On over 100 hectares there are 89 laboratories, including a National Lab and seven State Key Laboratories.

The French Grand École of engineering, École Centrale, has been working with BUAA since 2005 to create an engineering graduate programme called École Centrale de Pékin, which will take in only the Chinese students with the top results from the National College Entrance Examination."
Boston College,251–300,United States,"Founded in 1863, Boston College was set up by Jesuits to educate the city’s predominantly Catholic Irish immigrant community.

It is a private research university known as “The Heights” to its students and staff, owing to its location perched in the village of Chestnut Hill in Massachusetts.

Boston College has some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in North America, and has expanded since its inception to include nine schools and colleges, primarily in the liberal arts.

The idea of a college for Boston was first announced by the city’s second bishop in 1825, but struggled to find its feet amid suspicion from Protestants in the city and its distance from Maryland, where Jesuits were better established.

It was continued, however, and received a formal charter from Massachusetts in 1863, with an intake of about 22 students the following year and a special emphasis on philosophy and theology – which continues today.

The 175 acre main campus outside Boston city centre has more than 120 buildings, with eight research libraries and more than 700 academic staff working across them.

Designed by Charles Donagh Maginnis, the campus was never completed along the lines of the architect’s plans for a complex cruciform layout, but the centre at least was built according to plan.

Gasson Hall, St Mary’s Hall, Devlin Hall and the Bapst Library are the key examples of the gothic style, and still seen as the campus’ recognisable middle.

Out of an applicant pool of 29,486, the college accepted about 9,000 on to its undergraduate studies for the class graduating in 2019, with some 14,000 in total enrolling – giving it an acceptance rate of about 29 per cent.

With an endowment of more than $2 billion as of 2014, Boston College is one of the wealthiest colleges in the region – although its wealth does not come close to Harvard’s $30 billion."

Florida State University,301–350,United States,"Florida State University has its roots in the development of a state higher education system in the nineteenth century, and by 1897, it was Florida’s first liberal arts institution. By the outbreak of the Second World War, it had a fully-fledged sports culture and numerous student associations.

In the 1950s the university added business, journalism and nursing departments, and after the turn of the millennium it built a new college of medicine. It now also has study abroad centres in London, Florence, Valencia and Panama.

Florida State boasts hundreds of student organisations, 25 locations across campus to eat, and even a “renegade runner” on call to deliver snacks to students too busy studying.

The university also has one of only two collegiate circuses in the United States, the FSU Flying High Circus, which dates back to 1947. Student performers sew their own costumes, rig up light and sound for performances, and erect a big top tent on campus.

The university’s vision is to be “one of the world's premier institutions of higher education, devoted to transforming the lives of our students, shaping the future of our state and society, and offering programs of national and international distinction in a climate of inquiry, engagement, collegiality, diversity, and achievement.”"

University of the Witwatersrand,301–350,South Africa,"Commonly known as “Wits”, the University of the Witwatersrand developed out of the South African School of Mines, set up in Kimberley in 1896. The institution moved to Johannesburg in 1904 and acquired full university status in 1922. From the start, it embraced a philosophy of non-discrimination on the basis of race, which led to intense conflict with the government - including police raids and the detention of both faculty and students - during the apartheid era.

Though located largely in the district of Braamfontein in central Johannesburg, a major expansion programme in the 1960s and 1970s saw the university establishing facilities in other areas of the city such as Hillbrow and Parktown. It also acquired two farms about 40 kilometres to the north-west, Sterkfontein and Swartkrans, which incorporate a celebrated set of limestone caves and have proved a rich source of archaeological remains.

Its location in Johannesburg means that Wits is close to the economic powerhouse of the whole African continent. It was one of the founders of the African Research Universities Alliance and has an active programme of collaborative projects right across Africa and beyond. Highly research-intensive, it has made a major contribution to applied areas such as healthcare and the challenges of deep-level mining but performs strongly in subatomic physics and other fields of fundamental science.

The most famous alumnus of the university is Nelson Mandela, who studied law there and went on to become President of South Africa and the 1993 Nobel laureate for peace. The novelist Nadine Gordimer (Nobel Prize for Literature, 1991) also attended for a year, while Aaron Klug (Nobel Prize for Chemistry, 1982) and Sydney Brenner (Nobel Prize for Medicine, 2002) both took their first degrees at Wits.

University College Cork,351–400,Ireland,"On a limestone bluff overlooking the River Lee in Ireland is University College Cork (UCC). Its motto ‘Where Finbarr Taught, Let Munster Learn,’ refers to the 6th century Saint Finbarr, whose monastery and school once stood nearby.

Originally named Queen’s College, Cork, the university was established to provide access to higher education in the Irish province of Munster (Ireland's second city), and was named after Queen Victoria, along with two other Queen’s Colleges in Galway and Belfast.

UCC's first students arrived in 1849 and, from 1850, the institution formed part of the Queen's University of Ireland. In the 1880s it became part of the Royal University of Ireland, and by 1908 joined the federal National University of Ireland (NUI), where it was a founding member.

The landscaped gardens and surrounds of UCC are known as ‘the quad’ and superstition holds that students crossing the quad before graduation risk bad luck and failure in exams.

Alongside the quad, the university is centred around its Aula Maxima – the Great Hall, which acts as the ceremonial and symbolic heart of the university. The Hall's design, inspired by the great universities of the Middle Ages, was the work of renowned Irish architects Thomas Deane and Benjamin Woodward.

Since 1908, UCC has grown exponentially, offering a research-led curriculum across 120 degree programmes in Humanities, Business, Law, Architecture, Science, Medicine and more. With a student body of some 20,000, including 3,000 international students, UCC returned to being a university in its own right again in 1997, retaining its original name.

UCC’s alumni includes the prominent mathematician Professor George Boole, who most famously invented Boolean logic, as well as the feminist and politician, Mary MacSwiney.

Among UCC’s many historical collections and artefacts are the ancient Ogam stones, thought to be the earliest written source of the Irish language."

The University of Montpellier has changed significantly in recent history – following the civil unrest in France in May 1968 that saw mass demonstrations and strikes across the country, the university was reorganised and split into three separate institutions. From 1970, the university was divided into the University of Montpellier 1, which housed the former departments of medicine, law and economics, the University of Montpellier 2, which housed the departments of science and technology, and the Paul Valery University of Montpellier 3, which was home to the social sciences, humanities and liberal arts faculties.

In 2015 the University of Montpellier 1 and the University of Montpellier 2 merged after 45 years of separation, forming today’s University of Montpellier. The Paul Valery University of Montpellier 3, now known as the Paul Valery University in homage to the French writer who studied in Montpellier, remains a separate institution.

Today, the University of Montpellier is made up of the following nine faculties: Economic and Social Administration, Pharmacy, Science, Economics, Law and Political Science, Dentistry, Sports, Medicine, and Education. There are also three Institutes of Technology, three institutes in the fields in administration and business and two specialized schools: Polytech Montpellier Engineering School and OREME, which is a research observatory.

The history of the university stretches back to 1801, when South Carolina College was established as part of the Southern public college movement which was encouraged by Thomas Jefferson.

The institution flourished in the decades prior to the American Civil War, with the historic horseshoe-shaped campus district which still stands today taking shape during this era.

But the war had a devastating impact on the institution, forcing its closure in 1863 as students volunteered for Confederate service.

The institution was re-established in 1865 as the University of South Carolina, and led the way on racial integration for a time, enrolling its first black students in 1873 – the only southern state university to do so.

However, funding shortages forced the closure of the university again in 1877, and it reopened three years later as an all-white agricultural college. Black students were not admitted again until 1863.

Nowadays, the Irvin department of rare books and special collections is home to the world’s largest collection of works by Ernest Hemingway and the largest collection of Robert Burns works and associated Scottish literature outside Scotland.

Missouri University of Science and Technology,501–600,United States,"Located in the city of Rolla, the Missouri University of Science and Technology – commonly known as Missouri S&T – was founded in 1870 as the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy. It was then one of pioneering technological institutions anywhere to the west of the Mississippi and still puts great stress on the sciences, and particularly engineering, though it is now very much a comprehensive university offering a range of courses in the liberal arts and humanities as well.

Four cutting-edge research areas have been identified in the Missouri S&T strategy. Advanced manufacturing explores techniques such as the application of nanotechnology and intelligent systems enabled by sensors, while advanced materials offers practical solutions to core national challenges such as replacing hundreds of defective bridges and ensuring reliable energy and water supplies. Other researchers are looking at ways of developing “smart” environments and “intelligent cities”, and providing the materials needed in extreme environments. There is a strong focus on interdisciplinarity in all the research centres, which often leads to many kinds of scientists (and sometimes social scientists) working alongside each other to achieve common goals.

The campus, where all students live for their first two years,, is home to over 200 societies covering interests from backpacking to ballet. It also features a millennial arch; a reconstruction of part of Stonehenge, which students “carved”’ out of around 160 tons of granite with water jets in the 1980s; and the James E. Bertelsmeyer Hall, housing some of the country’s best equipment for research in chemical and biochemical engineering, which opened in 2014.

Notable pre-existing institutions include the Hiroshima Higher Normal School, set up in 1902, one of two national training centres for mid-school teachers; a university focussing on literature and science (1929); and a technical college (1920) which forged strong links with Japanese industry.  Along with three other teacher training colleges which also became part of Hiroshima University, these institutions were severely damaged by the atom bomb dropped on the city in August 1945. It was precisely because the university was able to rise from the ashes of destruction that it adopted the phoenix as its symbol.

Hiroshima soon expanded its remit, adding both a medical school and postgraduate provision in 1953. This was followed in 1963 by what is now the Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, designed to study the impact of nuclear radiation and to develop practical measures for improving the lives of the tens of thousands of survivors of the bomb blast. Other research centres are devoted to fields ranging from early childhood education and peace science to regional geography and marine biology.

Like many other universities across the world, Hiroshima experienced student unrest in the 1960s. This led to a number of reforms. One of the most significant was bringing together virtually all the faculties on a single campus at Higashi-Hiroshima City. It is now widely recognized as one of the nation’s most prestigious and broadly based universities."

Particularly noteworthy is the Student Recreation Centre, a 5 200 m2 building managed by the students themselves. It is equipped with computer rooms, study and group work spaces, a photography lab, a rehearsal room, etc., similar to the MIT Student House.

As for the other two campuses, Alcoy combines history, nature, and culture in a wonderful setting between the Font Roja and Sierra de Mariola Natural Parks, areas of great scenic and ecological value. Gandia has 300 days of sunshine a year and a campus right on the beach.

Committed to the environment

In recent years, UPV has positioned itself as one of the200 most sustainable universities in the world. It is the only public university in Spain to have EMAS accreditation, the European label that aims to achieve continuous improvement in this area.

University of Canterbury,601–800,New Zealand,"Immersed in the heart of Ōtautahi Christchurch, Aotearoa New Zealand’s second largest city, Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC) provides an experience unlike any other university. Nestled between Kā Tiritiri o te Moana, the majestic Southern Alps, and Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa, the abundant Pacific Ocean, UC offers students endless opportunities for education, exploration and recreation, with all the conveniences of a modern city.

Outside traditional learning, we provide students the chance to find themselves, to connect with others and to positively contribute to a changing world. Our students are innovative and caring, and we are proud to support them to grow as individuals alongside the University of Canterbury Students’ Association, nurturing our warm and vibrant community. The global impact of the University’s highly skilled, industry-ready graduates is visible through a whānau (family) of more than 140,000 strong; a cohort of engaged and empowered alumni affecting change around the world.

Our vision for the University of Canterbury is a contemporary university, a place of learning that is grounded in our shared history, values our differences, and aspires towards research and tertiary education that is equitable and accessible to all. We are determined to remain agile, responsive and pioneering, pushing boundaries to meet the evolving needs of our students. Since the Canterbury Collegiate Union was founded with Henry John Tancred’s inaugural address in 1872, the University of Canterbury has stood for the encouragement of talent without barriers. In 2023, we celebrated our 150th anniversary by reflecting on our successes and learning opportunities, setting our aspirations for the next 50 years. We achieved record enrolments in 2024 which is evidence of our status as a future focused, engaging university.

We pride ourselves on delivering a high standard of education and facilitating creative and innovative research for the benefit of both local and global communities. The international networks paved by teaching and research excellence, provide opportunities for partnerships, research collaborations and student exchanges. Our academic leaders are encouraged to be courageous, forward-thinking and generous with their knowledge. They explore their fields of expertise with integrity and vigour, encourage conversations and challenges, and share their learnings with the intent of creating better outcomes for everyone.

People come first at the University of Canterbury, reflecting our intrinsic values: whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and tiakitanga. These values are rooted in trust, care and reciprocity, and were embedded over generations by the presence of the regions iwi (tribe)In-Confidence

Ngāi Tahu, and hapū (sub-tribe),Ngāi Tūāhuriri. In fact, in 1861 Pita Te Hori, the first Upoko (tribal leader) of Ngāi Tūāhuriri, instructed the founders of Ōtautahi Christchurch: “kia atawhai ki te iwi – be kind to your people.” Today, these words underpin the relationships we foster amongst our students, staff and community. We are proud to open our doors to students and staff throughout Aotearoa New Zealand and the world, welcoming everyone to learn from one another and contribute to our diverse and flourishing community. The University of Canterbury is a place for everyone.

Our relationships with mana whenua (indigenous people of this land) are integral to these aspirations, as we strive to ensure that Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi) is the bedrock of the University of Canterbury. As we continue to strengthen our partnership and grow our understanding of mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge systems), we are creating a programme of collaborative knowledge creation that sets the University of Canterbury apart. In doing so, we also acknowledge New Zealand as an integral Pacific nation and embrace the shared whakapapa (genealogical connections) and reciprocal relationships with our Pacific neighbours.

We seek to cultivate a spirit of curiosity that honours those who have gone before us, while contributing to the pool of diverse knowledge that we will in turn pass on to the next generation. In this, we are inspired by the Ngāi Tahu whakataukī (proverb): mō tātou, ā, mō ngā uri ā muri ake nei – for us and our children after us. We know that our students are our future, and we believe in empowering them to overcome the challenges of the changing world, and to create a more sustainable, equitable and inclusive future for us all.

The University of Canterbury provides a learning and research gateway, from the vast expanse of the galaxy to the depths of the Antarctic continent—offering the connection, understanding and opportunities that will enable us to overcome the challenges facing our society.

Our people are powered by resilience and determination, using our combined knowledge and experience to chart a course into the future – aukahatia tō waka, he hekenga tai roa. We stand with our community in times of need, mobilising our networks to provide solutions, resources and simple kindness.

There is a place for you at the University of Canterbury – nau mai, tauti mai – come join us.

Mission, Vision, Values and Focus

Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury"
University of Crete,601–800,Greece,"The University of Crete is one of Greece’s most illustrious higher education institutions.

This modern university has campuses in two cities on the island of Crete: Rethymnon, where the faculties of education, philosophy and social, political and economic science are located, and Heraklion, which has the faculties of science and engineering and medicine.

The university has a strong record of producing internationally significant research and has founded three of Crete’s prominent research institutions: the Natural History Museum, Skinakas Observatory, and the University General Hospital.

Although all of the university’s undergraduate courses are taught in Greek, the university's mission includes international cooperation and integration. It has staff and student exchanges with over 200 universities, and was selected as an Erasmus success story for its efforts to welcome international students to Crete.

Crete itself is one of Greece’s most popular tourist destinations. Its white sand beaches draw in sunbathers and swimmers, while its rich history makes it a must-see for fans of culture and architecture. Crete shares much of its heritage with Greece, but also has its own ancient culture inherited from the Minoans– the earliest known European civilisation, of which Crete was the homeland. The legendary Minoan ruins of Knossos can still be seen today.

Both Heraklion and Rethymnon are filled with examples of Venetian architecture dating from Crete’s invasion by Venice in the 13th century. Heraklion, as the island’s capital, has many of its best museums, as well as the stadiums for its sports teams, while Rethymnon is famous for its unspoilt old town."
University of Delhi,601–800,India,"Now one of the largest higher education institutions in India, the University of Delhi had relatively modest beginnings when it was set up by the British Indian Government’s Central Legislative Assembly in 1922. There were already three colleges established in the city - St Stephen’s College, Hindu College and Ramjas College – so all of them were affiliated with the new institution, which opened with around 750 students and just two faculties, for arts and sciences.

A major step forward came in 1933, when the offices and library moved to a location on the Viceregal Lodge Estate where the administrative headquarters can still be founded. Sir Maurice Gwyer, vice-chancellor from 1938 to 1950, pursued a tireless policy of recruiting the best talent from across the country, and greatly enhanced the university’s academic prestige. Five separate departments, covering the humanities and social sciences (history and sociology) as well as chemistry, geology and zoology, have now been singled out as Centres of Advanced Studies.

Proud of its role in nation-building after India became independent in 1948, the university retains strong links with the leading figures in the state. The Vice-President of India serves as chancellor and the chief justice as pro-chancellor, while the president holds the title of visitor.

As the city has expanded, the university has done so too, partly to provide access to those in outlying areas. A South Campus was opened in 1973, for example, and then moved to its attractively landscaped 69-acre present site in 1984. An extensive fibre-optic network now provides easy connections between all the different colleges and departments.

Since 1957, the university’s logo has featured a striking and unusual purple background incorporating an elephant, a river and an open book."

National Technical University of Athens,801–1000,Greece,"Established in 1836 as the Royal School of Arts, the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) started life as a part-time school teaching vocation skills to adhere to the needs of the newly-independent Greece.

As a result of increasing popularity and the demands of the new Greek state, in 1843 three new departments were created and by 1873 the university had moved to Patission Street, one of the major roads in central Athens and became known as Ethnicon Metsovion Polytechnion.

It was not until 1917 that NTUA adopted a form that resembles its modern-day structure, after a special law separated the NTUA’s industrial faculty into the schools that are more-or-less the same today.

The NTUA has also been at the heart of some hugely significant events in Greece’s recent history. After German troops occupied Greece from April 1941, the NTUA adopted a new role when it became a centre for the National Resistance movement, while maintaining its standing as an academic institution.

Perhaps NTUA’s most important role in history was during the Polytechnion Uprising of November 1973. After three days of demonstrations against the country’s military dictatorship where students barricaded themselves inside the university and called on the people of Athens to rebel, a military tank broke through the universities gates and the events that followed left several dead. The dictatorship fell the following year and the NTUA is commemorated annually on November 17 by the whole nation.

Today, there are nine academic schools that are split into 33 departments. The university is divided between its central Pattision Street, which now hosts only the School of Architecture, and the main 190-acre Zografou Campus which is 6km north of the city centre.

The NTUA remains one of Greece’s most prestigious academic institutions and has been attended by some key figures in the country’s recent history, including the Prime Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras."

Vilnius University,801–1000,Lithuania,"Vilnius University in Lithuania, founded in 1579, prides itself on being the oldest higher education institution in the country and among the oldest in the whole of Eastern Europe.

Originally established as a Jesuit College, it became a university under King Stephen Bathory’s charter, with Pope Gregory XIII approving the change. The Jesuit order was disbanded in 1773 and, following the Russian annexation of Lithuania, the university was renamed the Vilnius Principal School. Between 1919 and 1939, a period of Polish control followed and, at different times during the war years, the country came under both Soviet and Nazi rule, making progress difficult. Following the war, the university gradually began to expand and, by 1990, Lithuania returned to being an autonomous country.

Today, Vilnius University is home to over 1,300 academic members of staff and more than 20,000 students, including around 1,200 international students. It is organised across 14 faculties, most of which are based centrally in the city and close to halls of residence. Most degree programmes are taught in Lithuanian, with some subjects also taught in English and Russian.

A significant part of the university is still based on the site of its old campus in the Old Town of Vilnius, a particularly scenic part of the city. Most of its summer school courses are taught in the Old Campus to allow students to get a feel for the history behind the university.

In keeping with other historic universities, Vilnius has many traditions that its current cohort continues to honour. Each year on the first day of September, for example, a lively student procession takes place that stretches from Parliament Palace to the university’s main building. While its extra-curricular opportunities include a folklore ensemble called Ratilio and a theatre group, Minimum, that has existed for more than 440 years."

AGH University of Krakow,1001–1200,Poland,"Poland’s AGH University of Science and Technology (AGH UST) has a remarkable history of overcoming hardship.

In 1912, a coalition of miners first had the vision for the university, which was to be a training ground for the country’s mining engineers. The plan was approved by the Emperor Francis Joseph in 1913, but was almost immediately overturned by the outbreak of the First World War. It wasn’t until 1919 that the university finally opened its doors as the Mining Academy.

The Second World War brought tragedy to the university when the occupying Nazi forces targeted Polish intellectuals. Almost all of the Mining Academy’s staff were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. At the end of the war, survivors reopened the plundered university, the first technical university in Poland to do so. The staff then supported other technical universities around the country to resume teaching, displaying remarkable solidarity.

In 1947 the faculties decided to rename the university, calling it the Academy of Mining and Metallurgy – in Polish, Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza or AGH.

Today, AGH UST has some 17 faculties, most specialising in different disciplines of science and engineering. Several of these specialisations are unique among Polish universities.

In the 2026 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the University of Botswana (UB) has quietly but decisively stepped into the global spotlight rising into the 1001–1200 band. This is an improvement of 74 places over the previous year and with 94 new universities being ranked represents a significant rise in the rankings.

UB now ranks among the top half of African universities and holds a strong position in Sub-Saharan Africa—16th out of 56 institutions. For a small, landlocked country with a population of just over 2 million and just one comprehensive public university and three small, specialized public universities this achievement is both rare and remarkable.

UB’s performance is particularly strong in research quality and international outlook, areas where it now competes with institutions from far larger and better-resourced nations. In a global landscape where, small states often struggle for visibility, the University of Botswana has emerged as a leader. Among countries with populations under 10 million—such as Malta, Cyprus, Iceland, and Estonia, Namibia, Rwanda, Mauritius —UB, Botswana’s flagship university stands shoulder to shoulder with the best.

Reflecting on this milestone, UB Vice Chancellor Professor David Norris remarked:

“This achievement reflects our commitment to becoming a globally competitive institution. It is a tribute to the hard work of our faculty, staff, and students, and to our strategic focus on research, partnerships, and academic excellence. We are proud to represent Botswana on the world stage.”

The University of Botswana’s quiet climb in the rankings is a testament to what can be achieved even for a small state when national ambition meets institutional focus. It signals to the world that Botswana is not merely participating in the global knowledge economy—it is helping to shape it."

University of South Dakota,1001–1200,United States,"Based in the city of Vermillion, the University of South Dakota is the oldest of the six public institutions now overseen by the state’s Board of Regents, who are appointed directly by the governor. It was not until 1889 that Dakota Territory was divided in two to form the new states of North and South Dakota, but the institution’s origins go back to 1862, when the Territory’s first legislature decided on the creation of a university. The plans, however, came without the funds to make them possible, so it was only in 1882 that classes actually began in a courthouse with the support of the private University of Dakota.

By end of the following year, when there were still only 69 students, a public board had taken over the governance role and a College of Arts & Sciences had been set up. Growth soon proceeded rapidly. There were already 500 students when South Dakota became the 40th state of the union in 1889. And the early 20th century saw a steady development of disciplinary coverage, with the opening of schools of law (1901); medicine (1907), still the only one in the state; continuing education (1916); graduate studies (1927); and fine art (1931).

Now the state’s flagship institution, USD describes itself as a “big-time university with a small-college feel”. The attractive 274-acre campus above the Missouri River incorporates a number of striking 19th-century buildings such as the former women’s dormitories which now houses the administrative facilities for the social sciences. Also notable are the National Music Museum, the Native American Cultural Centre, the new home for the Beacon School of Business, completed in 2009, and a dramatic Wellness Centre for fitness and sport, which opened in 2011."

Orange is the university colour, and a number of shops on campus offer discounts to students on Fridays when they wear orange.

As well as boasting significant success in track and field events, the UTEP basketball team made civil rights history in 1966 by winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball championship with an all-black squad, inspiring the 2006 filmGlory Road.

Only of its kind origin: The ‘Banasthali story’ has no parallel across the globe. It originated in only of its kind situation when a father lost his promising daughter before its hour and decided to train other girls the same way. Thus, Banasthali embarked upon its journey with only five students way back in 1935 when the concept of education for the girl child virtually didn't exist. The founders went door-to-door to recruit students. There was no question of charging any fee and they also went door-to-door to collect donations to carry out their dream.

Banasthali provides world class intellectual education with emphasis on learning by doing. Young students are prepared for the roles and responsibilities they must be ready to take on in their years ahead, which is extremely crucial in a culturally, socially, linguistically and ethnically diverse society.

That tradition dates back until 1775, and in the years before 1918 was carried out under the auspices of the Franz Josef University, Kolasvar – the city’s name under Hungarian rule.

Two years later it took the name of Haţieganu, a specialist in tuberculosis who was the first dean in 1919, rector of the University of Cluj in the 1930s and defied the Communists by declining an offer to treat Stalin in 1952.

As of 2018 it recruits just under 2,000 students annually into its faculities of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, with small quotas allocated to Romania’s Roma population and candidates from rural schools.

Our History

Dharma Master Cheng Yen carries out our mission, “Extending our love beyond those we know to those who are not related to us, and feeling other people’s pain and sorrow when they are hurt or suffering.” After dedicating her life to compassion relief work, she realized sickness is the root of agony and the mother of poverty; she visualized education as a crucial to the infrastructure of a nation. Master began organizing and building a medical college. Tzu Chi University was thus established in the eastern region of Taiwan, to raise the level of healthcare and education, while inspiring students to do good deeds and help others. The university upholds the motto of “kindness, compassion, joy and unselfish giving” and strives to nurture students into those who respect for life and care for living beings. In early 2000, the affiliated primary and secondary schools were set up and a comprehensive education from kindergarten up to the Ph.D. It will be fun to see where what the future holds.

TCU Goals

Our goal is to prepare professionals who are committed to lifelong learning, analytical and critical thinking, and working with others; moreover, prepare those who embrace the spirit of Tzu Chi Humanities and are willing to tend to those in need.

Master Cheng Yen said,” Education is the work of purifying each person’s heart, the hope and a stabilizer of our society.” Thus, Tzu Chi University emphasizes the following:

Our Founder

“There is no one I do not love, there is no one I do not trust, and there is no one I do not forgive.” Dharma Master Cheng Yen harbors a persistent soul of beauty and good. In 1966, Master established Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation which practices the philosophy of relieving suffering, giving happiness, helping the poor, and educating the rich. For several decades, Tzu Chi Foundation has been growing. Today, Tzu Chi volunteers around the world reach out to the disaster areas, and relieve the suffering and agony of people in need.

Meaning “black gold”, Ouro Preto was founded in 1698 as a mining settlement and within a decade, it was renowned as the centre of the most notable gold and silver rush in the Americas until that point.

University campuses in the city offer a number of options for accommodation, and this has led to Ouro Preto becoming known as a vibrant student city. While the university initially focused on the study of law following its founding, it has considerably diversified its academic portfolio in recent years.

This includes the addition of courses in metallurgy, geology and medicinal studies, as one would expect given the university’s heritage, but courses are also now offered in humanities and the arts. As well as this, the university’s size allows it to offer extensive research opportunities, with students having access to a variety of research labs among other things. More than 40 postgraduate degrees are also available to study, including master's, doctoral and post-doctoral degrees."

University of Santo Tomas,1501+,Philippines,"The University of Santo Tomas (UST) is the oldest existing university in Asia.

The institution was established through the initiative of Miguel de Benavides, the third Archbishop of Manila. In 1605, he bequeathed a modest amount from his personal funds for the establishment of a seminary-college to prepare young men for the priesthood. Those funds and his personal library became the nucleus of the University of Santo Tomas, which was founded in 1611.

UST was first called the Colegio de Nuestra Señora del Santisimo Rosario, and was later renamed Colegio de Santo Tomas, in honor of the foremost Dominican theologian, Thomas Aquinas. The original campus was located in Intramuros, the walled city of Manila.

In 1624, the Colegio was authorised by the King of Spain to confer academic degrees in theology, philosophy, and the arts. In 1645, Pope Innocent X elevated the college to a university.

In 1680, it was subsequently placed under the royal patronage of the Spanish monarchy. It was King Charles III of Spain who granted it the title of “Royal University” in 1785, for its exceptional loyalty in defending Manila against the British invasion. In 1902, Pope Leo XIII declared the University of Santo Tomas a Pontifical University, and in 1947, Pope Pius XII bestowed upon it the title of The Catholic University of the Philippines.

In 1911, the university campus transferred from Intramuros to its present site, which covers a total of 21.5 hectares in the Sampaloc district.

In terms of student population, it is the largest Catholic university in the world in a single campus. Since its establishment in 1611, the university academic life was disrupted only on two occasions: the first was from 1898 to 1899, due to the Philippine revolution against Spain; and the second time was from 1942 to 1945, when the Japanese Occupation Forces converted the UST Main building into an internment camp during the Second World War.

Today, UST’s commitment to spreading the light to the youth, through education and evangelisation, has garnered reaffirmation through the recognitions it has received both in the national and international scene."

University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene,1501+,Algeria,"The University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene or Université des sciences et de la technologie Houari-Boumediene in French (USTHB) was established in 1974, when the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Algiers transferred to a new site at Bab Ezzouar, 15 km east of Algiers and near Algiers International Airport.

The university was built on an area of 105 acres by the famous Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, who is regarded as one of the greatest architects of the 20th century.
