Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/massachusetts-institute-technology-mit,1,North America,United States,"“Mind and Hand” is the thought-provoking motto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, known also as MIT. This motto enigmatically encapsulates this famous institution’s mission to advance knowledge in science, technology and areas of scholarship that can help to make the world a better place.

At its founding in 1861, MIT was initially a small community of problem-solvers and science lovers eager to bring their knowledge to bear on the world. Today, MIT has evolved into an educational behemoth, with some 1,000 faculty members and more than 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students.

MIT is an independent, coeducational, privately endowed university organized into five schools (architecture and planning; engineering; humanities, arts, and social sciences; management; science) and one college (computing). Yet the principle of educational innovation remains at the core of MIT’s educational philosophy.

MIT researchers are at the forefront of developments in artificial intelligence, climate adaptation, HIV, cancer, and poverty alleviation, while in the past MIT research has fuelled scientific breakthroughs such as the development of radar, the invention of magnetic core memory and the concept of the expanding universe.

Science and technology are not the only strings to MIT’s bow, however. Approximately 20 percent of MIT undergraduates join a sports team, and with 33 varsity sports MIT boasts one of the broadest intercollegiate athletic programs in the world.

A vibrant arts culture also permeates college life. There are 12 museums and galleries on campus, with the MIT Museum drawing nearly 125,000 visitors each year. Students participate in more than 60 music, theatre, writing and dance groups, and faculty members of MIT even include Pulitzer Prize winners and Guggenheim fellows.

MIT is set in 168 acres of grounds that extend for more than a mile along the Cambridge side of the Charles River basin. The campus features stunning landmarks designed by the likes of architects Alvar Aalto, Frank Gehry, and Steven Hollin, as well as buildings in a range of architectural styles, from neoclassical to modernist and brutalist.

At its edges, the campus merges with various Cambridge neighborhoods, including Kendall Square which is one of the most innovative square miles on the planet. The close association of industry and research has helped MIT alumni go on to launch more than 30,000 active companies, creating 4.6 million jobs and generating roughly $1.9 trillion in annual revenue. No wonder then that a nation of MIT graduates would be equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world."

Stanford University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/stanford-university,3,North America,United States,"Stanford University is a place of discovery, creativity, innovation and world-class medical care. Dedicated to its founding mission of benefiting society through research and education, Stanford strives to create a sustainable future for all, catalyze discoveries about ourselves and our world, accelerate the societal impact of its research, and educate students as global citizens. More than 7,000 undergraduate and 9,000 graduate students pursue studies at Stanford each year.

The university is located in the San Francisco Bay Area on the ancestral land of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe and first welcomed students in 1891. Covering 8,180 acres, Stanford has one of the largest university campuses in the US, with 18 interdisciplinary research institutes and seven schools: the Graduate School of Business; School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences; Graduate School of Education; School of Engineering; School of Humanities and Sciences; Law School; and School of Medicine.

Stanford University was founded in 1885 by California senator Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, to “promote the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization”. The couple’s only child had died of typhoid, and their decision to build a university on their farm was intended as a memorial. From the start the university was non-sectarian, co-educational and affordable, teaching both the traditional liberal arts and the technology and engineering that was shaping the new America at the time.

Fast forward more than a century, and Stanford counts 20 Nobel laureates within its community and is regularly ranked among the top three universities in the world. Nicknamed “The Farm” from the days when horses roamed there, Stanford’s campus is now home to a rich and diverse student life, with over 625 organized student groups.

Sport is popular, with students, faculty and staff enjoying state-of-the-art recreational facilities and wellness programs. Stanford offers 36 varsity and 33 club sports, as well as physical education academic classes, fitness and wellness, aquatics, intramurals, and adventure programming. Sports teams are referred to as the “Stanford Cardinal.”

Stanford also has a rich tradition of fostering creativity and the arts: there is a vibrant campus arts district and two world-class museums which host regular exhibitions. Eight dining halls, a teaching kitchen and organic gardens provide the campus community with healthy, sustainable meals."
University of Oxford,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-oxford,4,Europe,United Kingdom,"The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and is actually so ancient that its founding date is unknown – though it is thought that teaching took place there as early as the 11th century.

It’s located in and around the medieval city center of Oxford, dubbed “the dreaming city of spires” by the 19th century poet Matthew Arnold, and comprises 44 colleges and halls as well as the largest library system in the UK.

There are 22,000 students at Oxford in total, around half of whom are undergraduates, while 40 per cent are international students. A quarter of the city of Oxford’s residents are students, giving the city the youngest population in the UK.

The University of Oxford does not have a main campus, its buildings and facilities instead being scattered around the medieval city center. Its colleges each have a distinctive character and traditions often dating back centuries. Colleges are self-governing institutions to which students usually apply directly. There are four academic divisions within Oxford University: Humanities, Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; and Social Sciences. The university’s particular strength is the sciences, and it is ranked number one in the world for medicine.

Oxford is a youthful and cosmopolitan city with plenty to see and do. There are dozens of historic and iconic buildings, including the Bodleian Libraries, Ashmolean Museum, Sheldonian Theatre, the cathedral, and the colleges themselves.

Students can choose to spend their time studying or avail themselves of the many extracurricular activities available. There’s a strong musical life at Oxford, with clubs and societies spanning all genres, from jazz, through to classical and folk. Oxford is also ranked highly for sport, with its top rowers taking part every year in the world-famous boat race with the University of Cambridge on the River Thames. Drama lovers are also well catered for, with one of the largest and most vibrant university drama scenes in the country.

Oxford has an alumni network of over 250,000 individuals, including more than 120 Olympic medalists, 26 Nobel Prize winners, seven poets laureate, and over 30 modern world leaders (including Bill Clinton, Aung San Suu Kyi, Indira Ghandi and 26 UK Prime Ministers).

It has a friendly rivalry with Cambridge for the title of best university in the UK and is regularly ranked as being one of the top three universities in the world. Notable Oxford thinkers and scientists include Tim Berners-Lee, Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins."
Harvard University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/harvard-university,5,North America,United States,"Established in 1636, Harvard is the oldest higher education institution in the United States, and is widely regarded in terms of its influence, reputation, and academic pedigree as a leading university in not just the US but also the world.

Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, three miles north-west of Boston, Harvard’s 209-acre campus houses 10 degree-granting schools in addition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, two theaters, and five museums. It is also home to the largest academic library system in the world, with 18 million volumes, 180,000 serial titles, an estimated 400 million manuscript items and 10 million photographs.

Like most of the United States’ pre-Civil War colleges, Harvard was founded to train clergy, but Harvard’s curriculum and student body quickly secularized, and in the 20th century admissions policy was opened up to bring in a more diverse pool of applicants.

Now, a total of 21,000 students attend the university, each of whom at some point can be seen bustling past the famous statue of John Harvard, the university’s first benefactor and founder, which looks on benignly in the center of the campus. The bronze statue’s gleaming foot is due to almost incessant rubbing by tourists and students, who believe the act brings good luck.

Only the academic elite can claim a place at Harvard, and the nominal cost of attendance is high – though the university’s hefty endowment is such that it can offer generous financial aid packages, which around 60 per cent of students take advantage of.

As freshmen, students live in one of the dormitories in Harvard Yard, a prime location, and eat in the historic and picturesque Annenberg dining hall. Harvard students are active around and beyond campus, with over 400 official student societies including extracurricular, co-curricular and athletic opportunities. Whether playing on the field in Harvard Stadium, fostering entrepreneurial activities at the Harvard innovation lab or writing and editing at the daily newspaper the Harvard Crimson, student life is a rich and rewarding experience.

Harvard\'s alumni include eight US presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars. Whether it be Pulitzer Prizes, Nobel Prizes, or Academy Awards, Harvard graduates have won them. Students and alumni have also won 108 Olympic medals between them. The university is regularly ranked number one in the world, and the consistency of its chart-topping performances shows that success is yet to breed complacency."
University of Cambridge,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-cambridge,6,Europe,United Kingdom,"The University of Cambridgeis rich in history - its famous Colleges and University buildings attract visitors from all over the world. But the University's museums and collections also hold many treasures which give an exciting insight into some of the scholarly activities, both past and present, of the University's academics and students.

The University of Cambridgeisone of the oldest universitiesin the world and one of the largest in the United Kingdom. Its reputation for outstanding academic achievement is known world-wide and reflects the intellectual achievement of its students, as well as the world-class original research carried out by the staff of the University and the Colleges. Its reputation is endorsed by the Quality Assurance Agency and by other external reviewers of learning and teaching, such as External Examiners. These high standards are the result of both the learning opportunities offered at Cambridge and by its extensive resources, including libraries, museums and other collections. Teaching consists not only of lectures, seminars and practical classes led by people who are world experts in their field, but also more personalised teaching arranged through the Colleges. Many opportunities exist for students to interact with scholars of all levels, both formally and informally.

There are31 Colleges in Cambridge. Three are for women (New Hall, Newnham and Lucy Cavendish) and two admit only graduates (Clare Hall and Darwin). The remainder house and teach all students enrolled in courses of study or research at the University. Each College is an independent institution with its own property and income. The Colleges appoint their own staff and are responsible for selecting students, in accordance with University regulations. The teaching of students is shared between the Colleges and University departments. Degrees are awarded by the University. Within each College, staff and students of all disciplines are brought together. This cross-fertilisation has encouraged the free exchange of ideas which has led to the creation of a number of new companies. Trinity and St John's have also established science parks, providing facilities for start-ups, and making a significant contribution to the identification of Cambridge as a centre of innovation and technology. In addition to the collections on display in the University's libraries & museums, there is a wealth of sporting and cultural activity at the University of Cambridge, much of it organised by individual clubs and societies run by staff and students. Although the University does not offer courses in the creative arts or sport, there is a strong tradition of achievement in these fields, with many former students going on to gain international standing as artists, performers and athletes. Initiatives ensure that aspiring performers enrich their education with a high level of activity outside the lecture."
ETH Zurich,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/eth-zurich,7,Europe,Switzerland,"ETH Zurich is one of the world's leading universities in science and technology and is known for its cutting-edge research and innovation.

Located in Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, ETH Zurich has two main locations: in downtown Zurich and on a modern campus built on a hill in the outskirts of the town. Students at ETH face an intensive workload, but they can still find time for cultural and other leisure activities and for attending the many regular symposia and conferences on campus, where some of the best minds in science come to speak.

ETH students like to exercise their bodies as well as their minds, and there is a wealth of various sports on offer on campus. The largest annual event is the SOLA relay race , taking place in 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometers. More than 900 teams have been known to take part at once in the annual spectacle.

Since the 1880s, students have also been able to show off their best moves at the Polyball, a classic ball event, featuring live music by several orchestras and bands. Every November, 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers descend on ETH’s extensively decorated main building for what is usually an unforgettable night."

Caltech has a high research output as well as many high-quality facilities such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (owned by NASA), the Caltech Seismological Laboratory, and the International Observatory Network.  It’s among a small group of institutes of technology in the United States primarily devoted to teaching technical arts and applied sciences, and its fiercely competitive admissions process ensures only a small number of the most gifted students are admitted.

The university was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, with the mission “to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education”. It became a major hub of US scientific research in the early 20th century and was instrumental to the United States’ war effort during World War II.

Today, it is home to the Einstein Papers Project, an initiative seeking to preserve, translate and publish selected papers from the estate of Albert Einstein. It has also established an energy innovation hub that aims to discovery revolutionary methods of generating fuels directly from sunlight.

Caltech’s 124-acre campus is within walking distance of Old Town Pasadena and the Pasadena Playhouse District, and the two locations are frequent getaways for students. Life on campus is rich with social activities, clubs, associations and recreational facilities. Intercollegiate sport is taken very seriously, with the Caltech Beavers (the beaver – nature’s engineer – is the college’s mascot) competing in 13 intercollegiate sports.

Caltech also offers excellent opportunities for the study and performance of music, theater, and the visual arts, all activities that play a vital role in realizing Caltech’s mission to role in realizing the Institute's mission of ""educating outstanding students to become creative members of society"". Providing a touch of grandeur, the Athenaeum is a stately building in the center of the campus where members can go for formal and informal dining, meetings, rendezvous and private parties.

The balance at Caltech between a rigorous academic curriculum and activities that promote personal development ensures time spent there for students is both formative and an invaluable staging post to a successful career.  Although it may lack the reputation of Ivy League universities or the likes of Oxford and Cambridge, Caltech is undoubtedly one of the best universities in the world, a fact reflected in all the university rankings, which regularly single out technology and engineering as the school’s key academic strengths."

University of Chicago,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-chicago,13,North America,United States,"Established in 1856, the University of Chicago is a private research university based in the urban center of Chicago, the third most populous city in the United States. Outside of the Ivy League, Chicago is one of America’s top universities, and holds top-ten positions in various national and international rankings.

Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago has a glowing reputation for its professional schools, including the Pritzker School of Medicine, the Booth School of Business, and the Harris School of Public Policy Studies. University of Chicago alumni are responsible for the development of many academic disciplines, such as sociology, economics, law, and literary criticism.

The college’s crest sees a phoenix rising from the ashes, a reference to the fire, foreclosure, and demolition of the Old University of Chicago campus, with the current University of Chicago emerging triumphantly in its place in 1890. The old university was founded through a land endowment from the controversial senator Stephen Douglas, a supporter of slavery who authored the Kansas-Nebraska act. By contrast, the new University of Chicago was co-educational and funded through donations from wealthy Chicagoans and the oil magnet John D. Rockefeller.

Today, the University of Chicago has approximately 16,000 students enrolled, with a male to female ratio of 56:44. A quarter of all students hail from overseas, a nod to the institution’s progressive credentials.

Students run more than 400 clubs and societies, which consist of a typical mix of sports teams, arts, cultural and religious groups, academic and political groupings, and societies that promote eclectic common interests. Among the more famous examples are the University of Chicago bowl team, which has won 118 tournaments and 15 national championships, while the university's competitive Model United Nations team was the top ranked team in North America in 2013–14 and 2014–2015.

If you have an interest in media and film, then you’re well catered for: the university is home to the longest continuously running student film society Doc Films and publishes several newspapers and magazines. Budding thespians can join renowned improvisational theater troupe Off-Off Campus or learn how to broadcast at the university-owned radio station WHPK.

Illustrious alumni come in practically every field, including the novelists Philip Roth and Saul Bellow, political movers and shakers such as pollster Nate Silver and Obama strategist David Axelrod, pioneering balloonist Jeannette Piccard, and the fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones."
Peking University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/peking-university,14,Asia,China (Mainland),"The oldest higher education institution in China, Peking University was founded in 1898 as a replacement for the ancient Guozijian school (Imperial College). By the early 1920s, it had become a center for Chinese progressive thought, playing an important role in China's New Culture Movement, the May Fourth Movement, and the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989, among other significant historical events.

Peking University is a comprehensive and National key university. The campus, known as ""Yan Yuan""-- the gardens of Yan, is situated at the  northeast of the Haidian District at the western suburbs of Beijing.

University of Pennsylvania,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-pennsylvania,15,North America,United States,"The University of Pennsylvania is a private Ivy League research university located in the city of Philadelphia. It was founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin, one of the United States’ founding fathers, who was eager to create a school to educate future generations.

Franklin advocated a concept of higher education that focused not merely on the education of the clergy, but on teaching knowledge of arts and humanities, as well as the practical skills needed to make a living and to do public good. His maxim of “well done is better than well said” lives on today through its commitment to inclusive policies and innovation.

As of fall 2017, there were 21,599 students studying at Penn, split equally between undergraduate and graduate students. Penn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research, offering double degree programs, unique majors and academic flexibility. This means competition to study at Penn is fierce, particularly at undergraduate level. The admission rate for the class of 2021 was 9.3 percent, of which 46 percent were either black, Hispanic Asian, or Native American. Unusually for an Ivy League school, women comprise over half (54 percent) of all students enrolled.

Penn’s core campus covers more than 279 acres in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus, with the surrounding neighborhood including restaurants and pubs, a large supermarket and cinema.

Student life at Penn serves up opportunities to discover new interests and passions galore, through a wide diversity of social, political, religious, and cultural activities. There are cultural centers and one-of-a-kind museums on campus that allow the arts to play a leading role in student life such as the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, the Arthur Ross Gallery, and Institute of Contemporary Art, which are all major cultural destinations and easy for Penn students to access.

The university also takes sports and recreation very seriously, with students taking part in ice hockey, athletics and joining a variety of competitive, instructional and recreational sports clubs.

With its arts and sciences programs ranking in the top 10 nationally, and the employment prospects for its students among the brightest (Penn boasts one of the highest numbers of graduates who go on to become Fortune 500 CEOs), there is little doubt that the University of Pennsylvania deserves its Ivy League status and reputation."
Cornell University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/cornell-university,16,North America,United States,"""I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study,” is the motto of Cornell University, words first uttered by its co-founder Ezra Cornell. Cornell was founded in 1865 with the then radical intention of teaching and making contributions in all fields of knowledge.

Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. These are liberal traditions that Cornell holds dear: a recent article in the Cornell Chronicle heralded the first all-female class admitted to its famous Farrier program in veterinary science. Cornell was also the first university to offer degrees in journalism and the first to teach modern Far Eastern languages.

The main campus of Cornell is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York, overlooking the city and Cayuga Lake. It spreads over 2,300 acres and comprises laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums.

The architecture is an eclectic mix of Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings, international and modernist structures. There are other campuses and facilities in New York City itself such as the medical campus Weill Cornell in Manhattan, and the engineering campus Cornell Tech. Outside New York, Cornell has an outpost in the gulf state of Qatar, which is the first American medical college to open outside of the United States.

Ithaca campus sits at the heart of the Finger Lakes region, surrounded by green space and natural beauty. Students here are as likely to be found sitting under a tree with their nose in a book as they are taking advantage of the many clubs, societies and activities Cornell has to offer.

First-year undergraduates live on North Campus, while upper-level students often hone in on the communities that they have found, opting for a fraternity or sorority, a co-op, a themed residence hall, or an apartment off campus.

There are more than 1,000 organizations on campus, ranging from skateboarding to volunteer programs. Sporty or outdoorsy students can take part in courses as diverse as caving and rope climbing, and there are four sports centers for the fitness inclined.

Food lovers are also well catered for, with Cornell voted in the top ten universities for food, with more than 30 dining facilities across campus."
Tsinghua University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/tsinghua-university,17,Asia,China (Mainland),"Students looking for great engineering and computer science programs need look no further than Tsinghua University in Beijing, which since 2015 has been ranked as one of the best in the world for both disciplines.

Tsinghua University was established in 1911 in the wake of the anti-colonialist Boxer Rebellion, which saw the US fine China $30m as punishment. In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt negotiated with Congress a reduction in the sum, with the leftover money earmarked for university scholarships for Chinese students to study in the US. Tsinghua University was established as a preparatory school for the students’ trips abroad.

Today, Tsinghua’s motto of “self-discipline and excellence” has taken it far. Most university rankings place Tsinghua among the best universities in China, and famous alumni include President Xi Jinping himself, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1979. Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger, and Bill Clinton are among the distinguished guests who have spoken at Tsinghua.

The university is academically organized into 20 schools and 57 departments covering a broad range of subjects, including science, engineering, arts and literature, social sciences, medicine. Xinya College was established in 2014 as the school’s residential liberal arts college as part of a series of reforms to undergraduate education. Unlike other Tsinghua students who must choose a specific major upon enrollment, Xinya students can declare their majors at the end of their freshman year.

The campus of Tsinghua University is located in northwest Beijing, in the Haidian district, on the former site of the Qing Dynasty royal gardens. As such it retains Chinese-style landscaping as well as traditional buildings, although many of its buildings are also western in style, reflecting its American heritage. Like its archrival Peking, Tsinghua is known for having one of the most beautiful university campuses.

On campus, students keep themselves occupied with more than just academic study (although the heavy workloads mean studying is always a priority). There are more than 110 student clubs and associations covering interests such as science and technology, health and fitness, humanities, arts and public welfare.

Overseas students are particularly encouraged to join in the fun, with a host of extracurricular such as welcome parties, New Year’s parties, graduation parties, and visits to cultural and historical landmarks."
"University of California, Berkeley (UCB)",https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-california-berkeley-ucb,18,North America,United States,"Founded in 1868, the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) is a public research university and the flagship institution of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system.

Berkeley is one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and is home to some world-renowned research institutes, including the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and the Space Sciences Laboratory.

Berkeley alumni, faculty and researchers include 99 Nobel laureates, 23 Turing Award winners, and 14 Pulitzer Prize winners. Faculty member J. R. Oppenheimer led the Manhattan project to create the first atomic bomb, while Berkeley’s Nobel laureate Ernest Lawrence invented the cyclotron, through which UC Berkeley scientists and researchers discovered 16 chemical elements of the periodic table.

Berkeley started out with little more than 40 students but, as the first full-curriculum university in California, it quickly gained ground on its illustrious forebears. By the early 1940s, it had grown substantially and was ranked second only to Harvard.

During this decade, Berkeley gained further prestige through its radiation laboratory, which was instrumental in the project to develop an atomic bomb.  During the sixties, Berkeley gained a worldwide reputation for student activism, thanks to the Free Speech Movement of 1964 and campus opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1969, the then governor of California Ronald Reagan called the Berkeley campus \""a haven for communist sympathizers, protesters, and sex deviants,\"" though today’s students tend to be more politically moderate.

The Berkeley campus encompasses approximately 1,232 acres of the bay area of San Francisco, with many of its Beaux-Arts-style buildings recognized as California Historical Landmarks.

Three quarters of its 40,000 students are undergraduates, giving life on campus a youthful feel in vibrant, urban surrounds. Most undergraduate students live in residential halls, where they can make friends, work and play in a safe environment designed to enhance the academic experience through a culture of care.

There are also student co-ops and not-for-profit housing cooperatives for Berkeley students, with over 1,300 students living in 17 houses and three apartment cooperatives around the Berkeley campus. Students can play sports, and join clubs and societies spanning every imaginable interest. On campus, students can visit the Lawrence Hall of Science, watch sport at the newly-renovated California Memorial Stadium, take in a noon concert, or stroll through Sproul Plaza, the social heart of Berkeley campus."

Yale University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/yale-university,21,North America,United States,"Yale University is a private research university and a member of the prestigious Ivy League, a group of America’s most celebrated higher education institutions. Situated in New Haven, Connecticut, the first planned city in America, Yale was founded by English Puritans in 1701, making it the third-oldest higher education institution in the United States.

Today, the city, which is part of the New York metropolitan area, is very much dominated by Yale, though it’s also billed as the “Cultural Capital of Connecticut”. According to the New York Times, New Haven is also extremely picturesque, with “art almost everywhere you look”.

Yale University’s central campus spans 260 acres and includes buildings from the mid-18th century. The university is organized into 14 schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and 12 professional schools.

Undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum which allows you to think and learn across disciplines before deciding upon a major. Perhaps its most distinctive feature, Yale undergraduates are organized into a social system of residential colleges, which allows them to experience the cohesiveness and intimacy of a small school while still enjoying the cultural and scholarly resources of a large university.

A recently unveiled portrait of Barack Obama was by a Yale alumnus, and strolling across the Yale campus, you’ll find that you’re surrounded by public art. Be it in courtyards or plazas, lobbies or lecture halls, art at Yale inspires reflection and offers aesthetic pleasure.

College life is similarly rich, reflecting the diversity of cultures and nationalities on campus. There’s always a packed arts calendar which includes exhibitions at world-class museums and galleries. There’s also a Tony Award-winning theater, Yale Cabaret – a theater-restaurant run by students – and hundreds of student groups, ranging from the serious to the silly.

On top of this, you’ll also find the usual array of top quality sports facilities, a golf course and centers for tennis, polo, sailing, ice hockey, and more as well as competitive sports, with over 30 men’s and women’s varsity teams.

To study at Yale is to join great company: four Yale graduates signed the American Declaration of Independence, and the university has educated five US presidents: William Howard Taft, Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. It is rightly regarded as one of America and the world’s most prestigious universities, with competition to be admitted as fierce as it gets."
EPFL – École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/epfl-ecole-polytechnique-federale-de-lausanne,22,Europe,Switzerland,"Its roots can be traced back to the foundation of a private school in 1853, which to start with only had 11 students. Those days are long gone though, with the modern day EPFL one of two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology and student numbers in Lausanne now totaling over 10,000.

Located in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, EPFL is twinned with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich). As part of its research and teaching activities, EPFL is one of the only universities to run a nuclear reactor, a fusion reactor, a Gene/Q Supercomputer, and have P3 bio-hazard facilities.

EPFL has a very singular admissions process, which, for would-be undergraduates who are Swiss nationals, is not selective at all. At the end of freshman year, however, a block exam determines whether students can continue or have to repeat the year, with many home students dropping out entirely at this point.

The EPFL campus lies on the shores of Lake Geneva and consists of 65 buildings across 136 acres. Facilities include banks, bars, two museums – the Musee Bolo and Archizoom – as well as bars, restaurants and cafeterias.

There are students of 112 different nationalities here, though as of 2014 women made up only 27 percent of the student body. Life on campus is vibrant, with many student-formed clubs and associations providing social and recreational opportunities.

A wide range of sports and leisure facilities keep students physically active while studying. EPFL also has an active student media, publishing the monthly newspaper Flash and there are daily broadcasts on the student radio station.

Another priority on campus is the arts, with the university holding several annual music festivals each year. The largest is Balélec Festival, where 15,000 visitors descend upon the university to watch 30 concerts on two outdoor and four indoor stages."

Johns Hopkins University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/johns-hopkins-university,24,North America,United States,"Johns Hopkins University is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. It was founded in 1876, and named after its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins.

It blazed a trail among higher education institutions by being the first US research university, and today it puts more money into research than any other US academic institution. It’s also widely credited with revolutionizing higher education by being the first US institution to integrate teaching and research. To date, Johns Hopkins has spawned 27 Nobel laureates, including the former US president Woodrow Wilson.

Johns Hopkins is organized into 10 divisions on campuses in Maryland and Washington, DC with international centers in Italy, China, and Singapore. Johns Hopkins regularly ranks in the top 10 universities in the US, and is also competitive globally, especially for its undergraduate programs.

Johns Hopkins enrolls more than 24,000 full- and part-time students across its nine academic divisions with faculty members and students studying, teaching, and learning across more than 260 programs in the arts and music, the humanities, the social and natural sciences, engineering, international studies, education, business, and the health professions.

Applicants at undergraduate level are generally ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school class, and over time applications and selectivity has risen. For the class graduating in 2020, the acceptance rate was 11.4 percent.

Most Johns Hopkins undergraduates study at Homewood, a 140-acre North Baltimore campus that is home to the schools of engineering and arts and sciences. It’s a traditional college setting in the heart of a big and blossoming city, with red-brick buildings, tree-lined pathways, an iconic clock tower, and expansive green quads.

Nearly all undergraduates based in the main campus live in residence halls during their first two years, where they make friends and take advantage of what has officially been named one of the best campus dining programs in the US.

There’s also easy access to top class arts and culture: the school’s conservatory, the Peabody Institute, regularly hosts musical extravaganzas, concerts and performances, while the Center for Visual Arts, located next to the Baltimore Museum of Art, provides plenty of sources for artistic inspiration.

Off-campus, students can venture into Baltimore itself, a city with a rich history as a working-class port that has blossomed into a hub of social, cultural, and economic activity – yet retains a small-town feel."

Each undergraduate student spends the first two years on general education, while in the next two or three years students will delve into their areas of interest. Student entrepreneurship receives strong support from the University and its global alumni networks.

The motto of Fudan University is scientia et studium, quaestio et cogitatio, which means rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice. The University is highly praised for its time-honored tradition of academic independence and free inquiry.

Fudan is a member of the elite C9 League, also known as China’s Ivy league, and a Class A Double First Class University according to a national project to build world-class institutions and disciplines by the end of 2050."

University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-michigan-ann-arbor,45,North America,United States,"One of the foremost research universities in the United States, the University of Michigan was founded in 1817, before Michigan had even become a state, and moved from Detroit to what is now its Central campus in Ann Arbor in 1837.

Michigan spans 780 acres, which is made up of its Central and North campuses, two regional campuses, and a center in Detroit. It has a large student body of around 46,000, with undergraduates numbering two-thirds of that number.

Michigan has been lauded for having high standards of research, and the university’s comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as well as professional degrees in architecture, business, medicine, law, pharmacy, nursing, social work, public health, and dentistry.

Michigan's body of living alumni comprises more than a half million people, which is one of the largest alumni bases of any university in the world and a valuable resource for current students when it comes to networking and building industry connections.

Around a quarter of all students are accommodated on campus, with many residence halls serving undergraduates, and family housing that is intended mainly for graduate students. There are also off-campus apartments, houses, and co-operatives, which generally house upper division and graduate students, as well as ‘theme communities’ within residence halls, where students can immerse themselves among peers with similar interests.

Michigan has more than 1,600 clubs and societies, including engineering project teams, community service organizations, and charitable projects. The Michigan Marching Band is over 100 years old and has 350 student members, and other noted musical ensembles include the University of Michigan Men’s Glee Club, a men’s chorus with over 100 members.

Michigan has a history of student activism, and there are a number of groups dedicated to various worth causes. Some, such as the United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS), devote themselves to more left-wing causes, in this case holding to account multinational companies that exploit their workers in factories, but there are also conservative groups such as Young Americans for Freedom, as well as non-partisan groups.

Cultural and ethnical student organizations help students forge smaller communities from the large university population, and publications such as the Michigan Daily, published five days a week during the Fall and Winter terms, allow students to keep abreast of the latest news on campus."

A historic university city

Delft is an interesting and historic town located in the province of South Holland between the larger cities of The Hague and Rotterdam, the former being the seat of Dutch government and the latter, with its Europoort, the largest sea terminal in the world. Famous historical figures who once lived and worked in Delft are the painter Johannes Vermeer and the inventor of the microscope, Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek. If you look at the ancient canals lined with merchant’s houses, the old churches and the splendid town hall one sees that Delft’s rich history is still very much alive. At the same time it remains a very modern, safe and vibrant city."

Kyoto University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/kyoto-university,57,Asia,Japan,"Kyoto University is one of Asia’s leading research-oriented institutions and is famed for producing world-beating researchers, including 13 Nobel Prize laureates.

The motto of the school, which was founded in 1897, is “freedom of academic spirit”, a value it aims to instill on the 22,000 students enrolled on its undergraduate and graduate programs.

Kyoto ranks competitively in most major rankings, usually coming in the top two for Japan, the top 10 for Asia, and in the top 50 universities globally, making it a major player on the university scene.

The main Yoshida campus has been at the core of the university since its founding, and is notable for its fascinating architecture, encompassing a variety of styles, from brick buildings such as the Clock Tower Centennial Hall (a symbol of the university) to modern laboratory buildings.

Other campuses include Uji campus, which hosts research institutes, state-of-the-art laboratories and testing facilities, and Katsura campus, conceived as a “technoscience hill”. Mixing the traditional and cutting edge, there is therefore no one typical student experience at Kyoto, though what is common to all students is the sense of belonging to an academic community at the forefront of new scholarly horizons, in particular when it comes to new technologies and meeting global challenges.

For those interested in Japanese culture, the city of Kyoto will be of interest as it’s the birthplace of manga and was the capital city of Japan for over 1,000 years. Numerous cultural assets cultivated throughout its long history remain all over the city, and one in every 10 people there is a university student – by far the highest proportion of any Japanese city.

Kyoto is also blessed with an abundance of nature, surrounded by mountains and tranquil temple gardens. Parts of the city are also a conservation hub. Compared with Osaka or Tokyo, the cost of living in Kyoto is relatively low; as the city center is fairly compact, students can travel around safely by bicycle."

Its campus spans over 8,600 acres on three campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in Beaufort. The main campus – designed largely by architect Julian Abele – incorporates Gothic architecture with the looming presence of Duke Chapel, the campus' centerpiece that seats nearly 1,600 people and contains a 5,200-pipe organ.

Ten Nobel laureates and three Turing Award winners are also affiliated with the university, which is the second-largest private employer in the state of North Carolina.

From its early days as Brown’s Schoolhouse, Duke has evolved into a global academic and research powerhouse. Its Levine Science Research Center is the largest single-site interdisciplinary research facility of any American university, and in 2014 Duke spread its tentacles eastwards, opening a Chinese outpost, Duke Kunshan University, which blends an American-style liberal arts education with Chinese traditions.

Its recent academic achievements include three of its students being named Rhodes Scholars in 2002 and 2006. Also in 2006, Duke researchers unveiled the first working demonstration of an invisibility cloak, to the delight of Harry Potter fans around the world.

The university emphasizes four Educational Pillars: diligence, honesty, humility, and service, aiming to instill a strong sense of responsibility and a spirit of giving among its students. This ethos extends to contributing positively to local communities, the nation, and the global community at large.

Hanyang University's commitment to globalization is evident through various domestic and international programs. The Education Research and Industry Cluster at Ansan (ERICA) stands out as the nation's premier university-industry cluster, fostering symbiotic relationships with diverse industries to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.

Mission, Vision, Values and Focus

People come first at the University of Canterbury, reflecting our intrinsic values: whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and tiakitanga. These values are rooted in trust, care and reciprocity, and were embedded over generations of Ngāi Tūāhuriri and Ngāi Tahu presence in the region. In fact, in 1861 Pita Te Hori, the first Upoko of Ngāi Tūāhuriri, instructed the founders of Ōtautahi: “kia atawhai ki te iwi – be kind to your people.” Today, these words underpin the relationships we foster amongst our students, staff and community. We are proud to open our doors to students and staff throughout Aotearoa New Zealand and the world, welcoming everyone to learn from one another and contribute to our diverse and flourishing community. The University of Canterbury is a place for everyone.

Our vision for the University of Canterbury is a contemporary university, a place of learning that is grounded in our shared history, values our differences, and aspires towards research and tertiary education that is equitable and accessible to all. We are determined to remain agile, responsive and pioneering, pushing boundaries to meet the evolving needs of our students. Since the Canterbury Collegiate Union was founded with Henry John Tancred’s inaugural address in 1872, the University of Canterbury has stood for the encouragement of talent without barriers. With our 150th anniversary on the horizon in 2023, we are reflecting on our past so that we can take our successes and our learnings into the future as we set our aspirations for the next 50 years.

Our relationships with manawhenua are integral to these aspirations, as we strive to ensure that Te Tiriti o Waitangi is the bedrock of the University of Canterbury. As we continue to strengthen our partnership and grow our understanding of mātauranga Māori, we are creating a programme of collaborative knowledge creation that sets the University of Canterbury apart. In doing so, we also acknowledge New Zealand as an integral Pacific nation, and embrace the shared whakapapa and reciprocal relationships with our Pacific neighbours.

We seek to cultivate a spirit of curiosity that honours those who have gone before us, while contributing to the pool of diverse knowledge that we will in turn pass on to the next generation. In this, we are inspired by the Ngāi Tahu whakataukī: mō tātou, ā, mō ngā uri ā muri ake nei – for us and our children after us. We know that our students are our future, and we believe in empowering them to overcome the challenges of the changing world, and to create a more sustainable, equitable and inclusive future for us all.

The University of Canterburyprovides a learning and research gateway, from the vast expanse of the galaxy and to the depths of the Antarctic continent – offering the connection, understanding and opportunities that will enable us to overcome the challenges facing our society. We pride ourselves on delivering a high standard of education and facilitating creative and innovative research for the benefit of both local and global communities. Our international networks provide opportunities for partnerships, research collaborations and student exchanges. Our academic leaders are encouraged to be courageous, forward-thinking and generous with their knowledge. They explore their fields of expertise with integrity and vigour, encourage conversations and challenges, and share their learnings with the intent of creating better outcomes for everyone.

Our people are powered by resilience and determination, using our combined knowledge and experience to chart a course into the future – aukahatia tō waka, he hekenga tai roa. We stand with our community in times of need, mobilising our networks to provide solutions, resources and simple kindness.

Our studentsare smart, innovative and caring, and we are proud to support them to grow as individuals and members of our warm and vibrant University of Canterbury community. We offer endless opportunities outside traditional learning, giving our students the chance to find themselves, to connect with others and to positively contribute to a changing world.

University of Luxembourg,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-luxembourg,383,Europe,Luxembourg,"Uni.lu - 150 nationalities and the University has teaching programmes in 4 languages: French, German, English and Luxembourgish. The University of Luxembourg, short uni.lu, is more than just another university among many. The concept that uni.lu builds on is in many points unique and certainly does justice to the small country located between Belgium, France and Germany. The University has positioned itself as a multilingual, internationally focused research oriented institution, offering students an extraordinary environment.

Research and education meet the highest international standards and courses are taught in 4 languages: English, German, Luxembourgish and French. Founded in 2003, uni.lu has focused on the Bologna system from the beginning and implemented a well balanced offer of Bachelor and Master programmes in all fields of studies. The Faculty of Science, Technology and Communication offers Bachelors in the domains of engineering, informatics and life sciences as well as Masters in informatics, systems biology, engineering, mathematics and sustainable development.

The Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance concentrates on Bachelor programmes on economic sciences, law and business informatics. The Masters focus on banking and finance, European law, entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as data security management. The Faculty of Language and Literature, Humanities, Arts and Education offers Bachelors in educational and social sciences, psychology and European cultures.

The Master programmes range from philosophy, psychology, European history, mediation and gerontology to cross-border communication and cooperation, European spatial development as well as educational sciences in a multilingual context and Luxembourg Studies. Extensive training offer: Partnerships all around the globe. Only six years after the university's foundation, the University offers 24 Bachelor degrees, 51 Master's degrees, as well as 13 doctoral programmes to offer, with a possibility to carry on with a PhD in many disciplines. Whether English/German, English/French or German/French, many programmes are taught in two languages, some even in three. Moreover, the university also offers several Masters taught entirely in English. Furthermore, worldwide partnerships and exchange programmes are on top of uni.luâ??s agenda. Whoever completes a Bachelor in Luxembourg will not get around mobility: each graduate has to spend at least one semester abroad. Interchange agreements already exist with universities in 22 countries. At the same time the university is a real multicultural melting pot: 4500 students from 90 countries and professors originating from 20 different countries make currently a ""proportion of foreigners"" of 50 per cent.International flair also beyond the campusLuxembourg is a very international country.

The city accommodates numerous European Institutions, among others the European Court of Justice and the European Investment Bank, and is one of the leading financial centres worldwide. Students benefit from this situation in many ways: practitioners from various domains complete the theoretical study offer and make uni.lu a university which meets the requirements of our time. The combination of theory and practice particularly shows on the basis of research units, active in many academic areas, as for example the recently established Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), which dedicates itself to IT-security, and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB).

Research currently focuses on seven future-oriented areas which are security and reliability of information technology, life sciences, material science, European and business law, international finance, educational science and Luxembourg studies.

A personal touch and social responsibility

One of the many advantages appreciated by students is the personal atmosphere. It is easy to have the overlook over the university; everyone knows everyone else on campus and the professors are easy to reach.

Many courses take place in form of seminars, which encourages the active participation of students; Bachelor students are guided in tutorials. It is thus hardly surprising that most of the students do feel quite comfortable in Luxembourg and that they see uni.lu as their multilingual university, as the slogan says of the institution. This well-being effect and the simultaneous excellence of teaching will be improved in the coming years, thanks to the clear acknowledgment of sustainable development.

The university is member of the International Sustainable Campus Network, which aims at the improvement of teaching methods and university infrastructures. Considering all this, one can be sure that those six first years of the University of Luxembourg are only the beginning of a long success story."

HSE University’s degree programmes are focused on providing practical skills that are essential for today’s world and the future. At present, 98 Bachelor's degree programmes and 182 Master's degree programmes are available for international applicants. Some of these programmes are delivered entirely in English.

The University also provides grants covering up to 70% of tuition.

HSE University is highly attractive for talent from all over the world. Over 5,000 international students are currently at the University. In 2022, more than 6,000 applicants from 145 countries applied for admission, while more than 9,600 international students have been admitted to HSE University over the past five years.

Alexander Deev, Director for International Admissions

‘What makes HSE University so attractive to international applicants? HSE University is the undisputed leader among young universities, combining its own unique approaches and innovations with the best traditions of higher education. An HSE University diploma is a ticket to a successful future, as well as a guarantee of quality for any employer. Our diplomas are recognized and valued all over the world.’

Students actively engage in research in a wide range of fields, both making scientific discoveries and taking part in academic conferences alongside leading experts. For example, HSE University runs 51 scientific laboratories, over 100 research and study groups, research institutes and centres in the humanities, social, natural, technical, medical and agricultural sciences.

Each student can develop their own educational track. In addition to compulsory subjects, students can select additional track, i.e., a minor. A minor is a combination of four interrelated disciplines, pursued in addition to one’s major but not necessarily related to it. As a result, students further enhance skills, which are necessary for both work and life, allowing them to become versatile specialists.

Nikita Anisimov, HSE University Rector:

‘We start providing support to applicants from other countries long before they become HSE University students. For instance, we have a special advisory centre for them. There, we respond to all enquiries about admission and studies at the University. We assist applicants at all stages, from the submission of initial applications, to the selection process, to the provision of documents for enrollment, and, finally, to their arrival in Russia. After an international applicant joins the HSE University family, the Centre for International Student Support takes over and helps them to resolve any issues that may arise, including both academic and everyday matters.’

After graduation, students may decide to stay in Russia and work within their chosen field, or continue their studies under a Master's or doctoral programme at HSE University. There’s also the option of going back to their hometown or country after graduation, and, for the University, this is no less valuable.

From the very start of their studies, students learn how to solve real production and business tasks, and by the time of their graduation, they can quickly and smoothly adjust to today’s job market. Rankings also speak to the demand for HSE University’s alumni and the quality of education at HSE University. We rank among the Top-250 best universities in terms of demand for their alumni by employers in the QS Graduate Employability 2022 ranking, while placing second in Russia for graduate salaries, according to the Superjob ranking.

Universidad de Costa Rica,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-de-costa-rica,502,Latin America,Costa Rica,"The origins of the University of Costa Rica are rooted in the decrees signed in 1843, when the Casa de Enseñanza de Santo Tomás was transformed into a university. By the end of the XIX century, Costa Rica was an oligarchic and liberal country, whose policies focused solely on primary education. Therefore, this led to the closing of the University of Santo Tomas after 45 years of operation. This same decree created the higher schools of Law and Notaries, Medicine, and Engineering. Later, the schools of Pharmacy and Fine Arts were created in 1897. After 1890, higher education in the country was represented by professional schools and colleges that operated under the direction of their respective professional associations, as there was no higher education institution as such. During the first decades of the XX century, a few proposals to create a university were made, but they had no success given the policy that dominated the country. It wasn’t until the 1940s that the reformism in Costa Rica led by Luis Demetrio Tinoco prompted the immediate creation of the University of Costa Rica."

·        A Short History of IstanbulUniversity

The historyof Istanbul University dates back to the conquest of Istanbul by Sultan MehmetII the Conqueror in 1453. The Sahn-ı Seman Madrasahs (Conqueror Madrasahs),established after the scientific meetings in Zeyrek a day after the conquest,constitute the first ring of this scientific journey. The madrasahs, wheretheological and environmental sciences were taught together, became centers ofattraction with the reconstruction of Istanbul and the invitation of foreignscholars by the Conqueror. Flourishing with the support of the sultans, themadrasahs reached proficient status as higher education institutions particularlyin the 16th and 17th centuries. They were transformed into Darülfünun by SultanAbdülmecid in 1846. The Darülfünun works carried out by Grand Vesir Sait Pashawho tried to keep abreast with the speed of the Industrial Revolution.

Followingthe proclamation of the Republic, the young Republic of Turkey, in an effort toestablish educational system that is based on rationale and science, acknowledgedthe legal personality of Darülfünun and accepted the scientific andadministrative independence of the institution on October 7th, 1925. After thisdate, the higher education system tried to meet the needs of the new system interms of academics and materials. The infrastructure for a modern university wasset up with the support of foreign scholars invited to the country. With the 1933University Reform, conducted under the leadership of Atatürk, IstanbulDarülfünun was transformed into Istanbul University. Istanbul Universitystarted to accept students on November 18th, 1933, as the “first and only”university of the Republic of Turkey.

Their remit was to provide university teaching, in conformity with the requirements of the labor market and in close association with scientific research. Being a national institution, USEK has brought its teachings and curricula into line with the official requirements of the Lebanese state, which acknowledges the diplomas it delivers. Furthermore, USEK remains careful in achieving synthesis of tradition and modernism in the educational options it offers, while remaining true to a Christian humanism, which is imprinted on the overall education it provides.USEK has adapted well in light of soaring socioeconomic development and has created new vocational specializations, in order to diversify its education and meet the needs of the labor market. Its objectives also include the installation of welcoming and service-oriented infrastructures which rely on new information and communication technologies. USEK is concerned with the modernization of administrative procedures and academic systems, and also with providing continuous training.Nowadays, USEK welcomes more than 8,000 students across its twelve faculties and three institutes; i.e. fifteen academic units which offer a broad array of high-level diversified education."

The generalization of the practice of looking at complex problems under a mix of articulated lenses allows for more accurate analysis and more effective results creating possibilities for the reinvention of teaching and research practices. The institutional effort for renewal is something that Unifesp has been doing for some years, with profound changes in its organization and following the express mandate of its Institutional Development Plans. A fundamental component of this necessary change in thinking and doing science in Brazil is an active connection to the global state of the art in various knowledge areas. National scientific advances require a strategic and mature international insertion to dialogue in the fronts of scientific discovery, to transgress dated conceptions and to assert international leadership."

German University of Technology in Oman (GUTECH),https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/german-university-technology-oman-gutech,1040,Asia,Oman,"The history of the German University of Technology (GUtech) can be traced back to 2003 when visionary Omanis contemplated the establishment of a high-quality university of technology in Oman. This vision was inspired by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos’ directions for the provision of quality higher education in Oman by private investors.

RWTH Aachen University in Germany was approached with the intention of bringing German excellence in education to Oman. After a few years of discussion and negotiation, the founders were ready to begin a plan of action for establishing a university. In August 2006, Oman Educational Services L.L.C. (OES), a limited liability company under the laws of the Sultanate of Oman, was incorporated to establish a university on a formal footing.  OES is also the legal entity responsible for initiating education-related future projects.

A Collaborative Agreement between RWTH Aachen University and OES was signed in December 2006, paving the way for the establishment of a private university in the Sultanate of Oman. This cemented the groundwork for everything the founder envisioned: a high-quality university of technology in Oman. Specifically, the agreement laid the framework for collaboration between OES and RWTH Aachen University in terms of academic curricula, quality assurance and expertise, and setting up a technological university. All GUtech programmes have been developed in cooperation with GUtech with RWTH Aachen University in Germany.

In March 2007, The Ministry of Higher Education of the Sultanate of Oman issued a Ministerial Decision No. 9/2007 for the establishment of the Oman German University of Technology (OGTech). This was followed by the development of four Bachelor of Science programmes of study, namely:

In September 2007, the university opened its doors to students in rented premises in Athaibah. Initially, sixty (60) Omani male and female students joined the Foundation Year Programme (FYP). A preparatory study programme that acts as a bridge between high school and university education.

In 2008, the name of the university was changed to the German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech).

Shortly thereafter, in July 2009, GUtech was the first private university in the Sultanate of Oman to receive international accreditation by ACQUIN, a German-based accreditation agency, for its Bachelor of Science programmes.

With a continuously growing reputation, the university added two new Bachelor of Engineering programmes, namely:

With the same expansionary spirit, the university opened a second campus in October 2010. Given its location besides Muscat International Airport, the campus was known as the Airport Campus where all Bachelors’ programmes were taught. In 2011, the Bachelor of Engineering in Environmental Engineering was introduced, along with the first Master of Science in Petroleum Geoscience. By 2012, the number of students studying at GUtech reached nearly 700.

A renowned architecture office was commissioned to design a building for the flourishing university that would reflect Oman heritage and German Precision. In 2011, construction work began to establish a state-of-the-art campus in the Halban area, 25 minutes away from Muscat International Airport.

In September 2012, GUtech moved into its permanent campus in Halban, the first-ever Green Campus in Oman. The building earned the 2013 award of the best commercial building of the year in Oman, and in the Middle East.

In 2018, GUtech has added five Masters’ programmes through its different faculties. The programmes offer flexible modular learning to fresh graduates and professionals seeking to boost their careers in these fields:

Silesian University of Technology,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/silesian-university-technology,1096,Europe,Poland,"The Silesian University of Technology (SUT) is a place that, without any doubts, educates successful people. It is a modern higher education institution with 75 years of tradition in teaching, research and science. It was established in 1945 as a scientific and educational facility for Upper Silesia, the most industrialized area in Poland, and one of the most industrialized in Europe.

The SUT consists of fifteen faculties – eleven in Gliwice, two in Zabrze and two in Katowice. The main seat of the SUT is in Gliwice, a charming, 800 years old city and important scientific, research and design centre in Poland. Gliwice has nearly 200,000 inhabitants and thanks to the SUT it is the second (next to Warsaw) agglomeration of technical intelligence. During the last 20 years, Gliwice has transformed from a city based on heavy industry into a leader in the new technologies.

The University also established close cooperation with its business environment. In the entire Upper Silesia, there are numerous companies and special economic zones, including the Katowice Special Economic Zone, with numerous enterprises operating in the fields of advanced technologies. The SUT does it in order to reach its main objective, which is to train highly skilled engineering staff for the modern industry and to conduct and implement innovative research. The University also pays special attention to the development of entrepreneurship among its students.

The SUT is home to a vibrant community of almost 1,700 of the best and brightest minds. We attract academics whose passion and brilliance drives them to become leaders in their field. The university offers studies on bachelor, master and doctoral level. Studies are conducted in a full-time and a part-time system. The majority of bachelor programmes are 3.5 years long (7 semesters) and master programmes are 1.5 years long (3 semesters) with the possibility of an extension. Studies at the SUT give ample opportunities to broaden your interests. During the academic year, the university is vibrant with activities inspired by the Student Council and various student organizations, over 100 scientific associations and 20 different sports sections, such as basketball, volleyball, cycling, handball, skiing, aerobics etc.

The SUT is also a key player in new technologies. It is here, where new ideas are brought to life, and once applied by the industry they boost the competitiveness of Polish and international companies. The University received two ELSEVIER Research Impact Leaders Awards.

Bello University (ABU), a prestigious federal government research institution
located in Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria, has played a pivotal role in shaping
the educational landscape of the country. Established on October 4, 1962, as
the University of Northern Nigeria, ABU stands as a tribute to the Sardauna of
Sokoto, Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello, the first premier of Northern Nigeria. The
university is spread across three main campuses—Samaru and Kongo in Zaria, Kaduna
State and the School of Basic Studies in Funtua Katsina State. ABU is a
comprehensive institution with diverse faculties and programs. The Samaru
campus, serving as the administrative hub, accommodates faculties such as
sciences, social sciences, arts and languages, education, environmental design,
engineering, medical sciences, agricultural sciences, and various research
facilities. In contrast, the Kongo campus hosts the Faculties of Law and
Administration, offering specialized programs in Accounting, Business

Bello University (ABU) offers a diverse academic spectrum, including
undergraduate, graduate, associate degrees, vocational, and remedial programs.
Notably, ABU's Agricultural and Veterinary Medicine complex, housing renowned

research, healthcare and community services.

The
foundational years of ABU were marked by significant challenges. Established to
address educational disparities in the Northern Region, the university absorbed
existing institutions, grappled with a shortage of qualified students, and
faced infrastructural inadequacies. Under the leadership of Dr. Norman S.
Alexander, the university navigated these challenges by developing academic and
administrative structures, expanding departments, initiating major construction
projects, and experiencing a rapid surge in student enrollments.   ABU's
ambition and commitment to inclusivity were evident in its diverse range of
programs, spanning traditional fields to include engineering, medicine,
pharmacy, architecture, and various agricultural departments. Although founded
as the University of Northern Nigeria, ABU became a beacon of national
inclusivity, attracting students from every Nigerian state.

The
early 1970s witnessed an influx of expatriate teaching staff due to limited
local expertise. To address this, ABU initiated the Graduate Assistantship
program in 1975, focusing on internal staff development. By the mid-1970s, ABU
emerged as Nigeria's largest university, boasting academic strength and
extensive programs.     Covering
a sprawling 7,000 hectares, ABU encompasses 18 academic faculties, a
postgraduate school, and 111 academic departments. With approximately 45,000
students, 3,000 academic and research staff, and 5,000 support staff, ABU's
impact extends beyond its physical boundaries. The university has contributed
to the establishment of other institutions, including Bayero University Kano
and the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University of Technology, Bauchi, with 27
tertiary institutions affiliated to it.

Currently,
ABU stands as the largest and most extensive university in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Demonstrating unwavering commitment to education, research, and societal
development, ABU remains a cornerstone in Nigeria's academic landscape."

This nucleus of Damascus University was opened in 1903 and consisted of the faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy. The Turkish language was the language of instruction. In 1913, the school of Law was opened in Beirut. Most of the instructors were Arabs and they used Arabicas the language of instruction. The school was moved to Damascus in 1914 and returned to Beirut in 1915. The School of Law returned to Beirut once more by the end of the World War I. In 1919, the Medical Institute and the School of Law were founded on January 1stand September 2nd respectively. In 1923, the School of Law was renamed the Institute of Law. Also, the Institute of Law and that of Medicine, the Arab Academy and the House of Antiquity were united under the name of the Syrian University. Since then and until 1958, the year of the unity between Syria and Egypt and the establishment of the United Arab Republic, the institutions of higher education became as follows: The Institute of Medicine, the Institute of Law, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Arts, Higher Institute for Teachers, Faculty of Engineering in Aleppo, Faculty of Sharia and the Institute of Business. In 1958, a new law was issued to organize universities in the Northern and Southern regions of the United Arab Republic, under which the ""Syrian University"" was renamed ""Damascus University"" and,consequently, a second university was established in the Northern Region under the name of ""Aleppo University"".  A number of professors were loaned or seconded to other universities in the Arab world. Hundreds of university books were authored in Arabic by university professors, and students were provided with these books to facilitate their study and research. This is a quick overview of the history of Damascus University. We, at Damascus University, find that though our accomplishments were below our ambition, we are still looking forward to a brighter and more brilliant future, and to a day in which we can be proud of the great achievements of the scientific research held within the walls of our university."

It is the industrial engineer training center of the country during building and development processes, and the cradle of high quality human resources for the country’s modernization and industrialization.

In its early days, the whole University concentrated its efforts on settling facilities for classrooms and laboratories by renovating and buying new equipment; and at the same time, on the development of managerial and teaching staff to prepare basic conditions for the opening of the First Cohort.

During those challenging days, HUST received strong support from international friends, especially the Government, people and universities of the former Soviet Union through staff development programs, lesson planning and pedagogical orientation.

In 1960, HUST inaugurated the construction of its new campus based on Soviet specialists’ design. The chosen location was the Indochina boarding school (previously the dormitory area of students from the three Indochinese countries under Vietnam’s French colonization, built in 1938), bordered by Bach Mai street (to the east), Dai Co Viet street (to the north), the Old South, or present-day Giai Phong (to the west), and Dai La (to the south). Nowadays, HUST is still one of the universities having the largest areas nationwide.

The first President of HUST was Engineer, Professor and Academician Tran Dai Nghia (1913-1997). He was a leading scientific and technical manager who laid the foundation for Vietnam’s Defense Industry.

In line with the world’s integration and development tendency, and with open cooperation policies aimed to improve the quality of research and technology transfer, HUST is a prestigious address for foreign and domestic technology development investors, businesses and financial institutions.

"ITESO, Universidad Jesuita de Guadalajara",https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/iteso-universidad-jesuita-de-guadalajara,1239,Latin America,Mexico,"ITESO is the Jesuit University of Guadalajara, in Mexico. It
was founded over 60 years ago by a group of Jesuits, families and local
business leaders who sought a different kind of university that would combine
rigorous professional training with an education that would inspire men and
women with a profound sense of social responsibility and justice. ITESO´sprograms are imbued with the educational
philosophy of Jesuit institutions, recognized worldwide for training
well-rounded leaders in the fields of the arts and sciences. With approximately
11000 students and 42700 graduates, ITESO offers a robust combination of
professional advancement and knowledge production in the sciences. It houses
state of the art programs in engineering, humanities and the social sciences.

As part of its mission, ITESO is called to offer
solutions and alternatives for and with society.

The university community adad—made
up of students, graduates, academics, researchers and other collaborators—has
focused its efforts and its theoretical, methodological, and technical
knowledge on creating solutions that address the challenges brought on by the
pandemic, in the form of proposals for social and technological innovation, as
well as programs and initiatives for counseling, dissemination and support for
the most vulnerable sectors. This is evidenced by over 90 projects of applied
research and 60 conferences, round tables, forums, and discussions about Sustainability
and Technology, Identities, Social Inclusion and Health, The Solidarity Economy
and Decent Employment and Justice and Democracy.

PAPs

Professional Application Projects (PAPs) are unique to
the university and form an essential part of students’ integral education in
all of ITESO’s undergraduate and engineering programs. Most PAPs are developed
in off-campus scenarios and seek to respond to the most immediate needs of
society at both the local and national levels, as well as to change the
approaches of other projects to adapt them to the needs of the current context.

They are developed with a logic of nodes that bring
together several initiatives according to the thematic areas of confluence,
with the purpose to provide a powerful response to achieve the desired impact
in the current situation, embracing complexity and steering clear of atomized
efforts. PAPs are grouped into four macro-problems: Fair Alternatives to the Market
and Material Redistribution; Health, Dignity, and Care for People; State Capture
and the Construction of the Public Interest; and Environmental Degradation.

Collaboration and multidisciplinary approach: the key

Collaboration with civil organizations, research
centers, government agencies, companies, and other educational institutions has
always been a pillar of ITESO’s projects, even more so during the health emergency.
Rather than individual efforts, ITESO's proposal has focused on working jointly
to find solutions that contribute to the common good and prioritize the welfare
of the most vulnerable sectors, with multidisciplinary, scientific, and
academic collaboration serving as the means to overcome the difficulties caused
by the pandemic.

in other institutions of the Jesuit University System in Mexico. The university
also conducted in-person exams.

Graduation Ceremonies

filters occurred during graduation ceremonies at the end of 2020. Sanitation
protocols were put into place, and different stations were installed throughout
the campus so that recent graduates could enjoy their academic ceremony
accompanied, via livestreams, by their families.

Library Loans

Nearly one thousand people from the community,
including students, alumni, and staff, have received books and audiovisual
material at their homes. A total of 5,400 books (4,833 different titles) have
been loaned during this period.

Selcuk University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/selcuk-university,1292,Asia,Türkiye,"While the issue of opening a university in Konya was first brought to the agenda with a draft law prepared in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in 1955, the bill signed by more than half of the deputies, unfortunately, could not pass the National Education Commission. The first serious step towards having a university was taken with the Selçuk Education Institute and the Higher Islamic Institute, which were opened in 1962 under the Ministry of National Education.  In order to strengthen and develop this first step, the ""Association for Establishing and Sustaining the University"" was founded in Konya in 1968, and as a result of outstanding efforts, the School of Engineering and Architecture, which constitutes the nucleus of today's Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, was established. Although it did not have a building, classrooms, staff and budget, This college, which started to serve in a building belonging to the Child Protection Agency (next to Gazi High School) in the 1970-1971 academic year with the efforts of the Association for the Establishment and Survival of the University, was named Konya State Architecture and Engineering Academy in accordance with Article 9 of Law No. 1418 dated July 5, 1971 . The transition process from these three schools, which constituted the preparation stage for the establishment of the university, to a more effective university took place in 1975. With the Law No. 1873 on the Establishment of 4 Universities, which came into force on April 11, 1975, it was foreseen to establish four universities in our country and Selçuk University was established based on this law. In the 1976-1977 academic year, it started its activities with 2 faculties, 7 departments, 327 students and 2 permanent faculty members, namely the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Letters. The breakthrough year for Selçuk University was 1982. With the Decree Law No. 41 dated July 20, 1982, it was decided to merge the Faculties of Science and Literature, which constituted the core of the university in the first place, into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Selçuk Higher Teacher Training School into the Faculty of Education, Konya State Engineering-Architecture Academy into the Faculty of Engineering-Architecture, and Konya Higher Islamic Institute into the Faculty of Theology.It was decided to transform the Konya Higher Islamic Institute into the Faculty of Theology.In addition, the Faculties of Law, Medicine, Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine and the Institutes of Health, Science and Social Sciences were established; the School of Foreign Languages was abolished and transformed into Konya Vocational School; Niğde Vocational School was established in Niğde; the Girls' Art Higher Teacher Training School was transformed into the Girls' Art Education School; and the Niğde Education Institute was transformed into the School of Education.

Thus, Selçuk University reached the level of 8 faculties, 4 colleges and 3 institutes at once with the “Decree Law No. 41”. Selcuk University, which experienced a rapid rise in physical, social, cultural and sports fields, especially in the scientific field until the end of the 2000s, increased the number of faculties within its body to 24 as of 2011. However, in December 2011, with the decision of the Council of Ministers and the approval of the President of that day, Mr. Abdullah Gül, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Ahmet Keleşoğlu Faculty of Education and Faculty of Theology, located in the Meram campuses of Selçuk University, were connected to Konya Necmettin Erbakan University, the second state university in Konya. With the decision of the Council of Ministers published in the Official Gazette dated April 26, 2013, Seydişehir Ahmet Cengiz Engineering Faculty, Seydişehir Vocational School, Seydişehir Health Services Vocational School, Ereğli Engineering and Natural Sciences Faculty, Ereğli Education Faculty and Konya Ereğli Kemal Akman Vocational School were also added to Necmettin Erbakan University .

By harnessing novel technologies that inject interest and introduce flexibility into the theoretical practices of learning, the university has made its students able to study and work wherever they want, whenever they want, with whoever they want. As a result, seminars and workshops deliver a deeper, more meaningful relationship with lecturers and professors, more time to explore, challenge and question, whilst leaving space and time for individual support, advice and guidance.

Its first faculties either were dissolved or became independent institutions. These independent higher education institutions became a sole university at the end of September 1962. By 1968, our institution had become an independent university, with a prestigious academic staff; this was the ideal for which many leading Romanian intellectuals, especially those from the Banat region, had fought. Unfortunately, there followed a difficult period for Humanities and Exact Sciences. Fields of study such as Music, Fine arts, History, Geography, Biology, and Chemistry disappeared one by one; Philology was considerably reduced. As a result, many of the faculties were transferred to other institutions. 1989, the year of the Romanian revolution, was a turning point in the evolution of our university. It led to the present-day conditions. That is why the current structures and achievements make the University a trusted partner. An essential mentality change took place in the perception of the academic institution, in accordance with the democratic institutions in Western Europe. A substantial institutional reform was carried out, beginning with the redefining of the university’s mission by establishing its objectives."

UTEP’s campus is particularly striking, with many buildings constructed in the style of Bhutanese dzongs. The massive sloping walls and overhanging roofs which are a feature of this type of construction are rarely seen outside of Tibet or Bhutan, and their presence on UTEP’s campus can be traced to the wife of the school’s first dean. After a fire in 1916 destroyed most of the original campus buildings, Kathleen Worrell suggested the new buildings follow a design she had seen in an issue of National Geographic."
