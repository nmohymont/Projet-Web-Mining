1,University of Oxford,"The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world’s second oldest surviving university. While its exact founding date is unknown, there is evidence that teaching took place as far back as 1096.

Located in and around Oxford’s medieval city centre, the university comprises 44 colleges and halls, and over 100 libraries, making it the largest library system in the UK.

Students number around 22,000 in total, just over half of whom are undergraduates while over 40 per cent are international, representing 140 countries between them.

Called the ""city of dreaming spires"" by Victorian poet, Matthew Arnold, Oxford has the youngest population of any city in England and Wales: nearly a quarter of its residents are university students, which gives Oxford a noticeable buzz.

Oxford has an alumni network of over 250,000 individuals, including more than 120 Olympic medallists, 26 Nobel Prize winners, seven poets laureate, and over 30 modern world leaders (Bill Clinton, Aung San Suu Kyi, Indira Gandhi and 26 UK Prime Ministers, among them).

The university is associated with 11 winners of the Nobel Prize in chemistry, five in physics and 16 in medicine. Notable Oxford thinkers and scientists include Tim Berners-Lee, Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins. The actors Hugh Grant and Rosamund Pike also went to Oxford, as did the writers Oscar Wilde, Graham Greene, Vikram Seth and Philip Pullman.

Oxford’s first international student, named Emo of Friesland, was enrolled in 1190, while the modern day university prides itself on having an ‘international character’ with connections to almost every country in the world and 40% of its faculty drawn from overseas.

As a modern, research-driven university, Oxford has numerous strengths but cites particular prowess in the sciences, having recently ranked number one in the world for medicine (if its medical sciences division was a university in its own right, it would be the fourth largest in the UK) and among the top ten universities globally for life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, and the arts and humanities.",United Kingdom,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-oxford

17,Columbia University,"Founded in 1754 as King’s College by Royal Charter of King George II of England, Columbia is the oldest university in the state of New York and one of the oldest in the US.

Its main landmark is the Low Memorial Library, which was built in the Roman Classical style and still houses the university’s central administration offices.

As well as its main campus in the heart of New York City on Broadway, Columbia has two facilities outside Manhattan: Nevis Laboratories, a centre for the study of high-energy experimental particle and nuclear physics in Irvington, New York, and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York.

More than 80 faculty members, adjunct staff and alumni of Columbia have won a Nobel prize since 1901, when the awards were first granted. These include chemist Robert Lefkowitz, economist Joseph Stiglitz and US President Barack Obama, who was given the Peace Prize in 2009.

Columbia has also educated Founding Father of the US Alexander Hamilton, US presidents Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and actors Jake Gyllenhaal, Katie Holmes and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

The private research-based university has 20 schools – which include architecture, planning and preservation; business; Jewish theological seminary; and law – and 23 libraries that are scattered across the city. Sponsored research from its medical centre produces more than $600 million annually.

Columbia Technology Ventures, the institution’s technology transfer office, manages more than 400 new inventions each year and has been involved in launching over 150 start-up companies based on Columbia’s technologies.

The university also has nine Columbia Global Centres, which aim to promote and facilitate collaboration between the university’s staff, students and alumni in order to address global challenges. These are in China, Jordan, Turkey, Kenya, India, France, Chile, Brazil and New York City.

In 2014-15, the university’s total endowment value passed the $9.6 billion mark.

19,Cornell University,"Founded in 1865, Cornell University is a private Ivy League university with a mission to “discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge”. A federal land grant university with a private endowment, Cornell has six locations across the world. Its main campus in Ithaca, New York State, covers 2,300 acres of the Finger Lakes region, and is so extensive that students can go hiking without even leaving the university.

It also has a graduate school of medical sciences in New York city, a base in Rome where students study art, architecture and urban planning, a centre for students to gain work experience in Washington DC, and a medical college at Education City in Doha, Qatar.

Cornell counts 45 Nobel laureates among its faculty members and alumni. Other notable alumni include Tsai Ing-wen, the president-elect of Taiwan, and Huey Lewis, frontman for the band Huey Lewis and the News.

The university boasts a number of unique student traditions, such as Dragon Day, when, in late March each year, a huge dragon is paraded across campus by first-year students of the College of Architecture, Art and Planning. Heckled by rival students from the College of Engineering, the dragon is then burned in Cornell’s Arts Quad. This ritual can be traced back to high jinx of the architecture class of 1901, and was formalised by students in the 1950s.

Another tradition that has continued since Cornell’s opening in 1868 is the Cornell Chimes – daily bell performances by “chimesmasters”. These performers are selected by rigorous, 10 week long competitions, although chimesmasters do not need to have any previous experience playing the chimes. After climbing the 161 steps to the top of the historic McGraw Tower where the bells are housed, chimesmasters play from a collection of more than 2,500 songs, from musicians ranging from Schubert to the Beatles.",United States,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/cornell-university
=20,Duke University,"Duke University, located in the US state of North Carolina, is one of the wealthiest private universities in America and a top producer of international scholars.

It was founded in 1838 as Trinity College but became known as Duke University only in 1924 after the Duke Endowment was established. The university describes itself as younger than most other prestigious research universities in the country.

The original campus was rebuilt in Georgian architecture as is now known as East Campus, after the 1930 addition of West Campus, Gothic in style and home to the impressive Duke Chapel tower.

There are 10 schools and colleges; the oldest is Trinity College of Arts & Sciences, founded in 1859, and the youngest is the Nicholas School of the Environment, established just 25 years ago.

About 95 per cent of all students graduate within four years of enrolling. In the 2015 entry class, the most popular majors were public policy, economics, biology, biomedical engineering and psychology.

Sports and performance art both thrive at Duke University, which competes in athletics and basketball, and hosts more than 60 art events a year.

In 2014, Duke Kunshan University opened in China, with the aim of integrating liberal arts education with Chinese tradition. Duke also has a partnership with the National University of Singapore to collaborate on a joint medical programme, which took its first students in 2007.

Overall, the university is one of the most competitive to get into. For the “Class of 2019” cohort, only 11.4 per cent of the applicants received a place.

Unusually, the university requires undergraduates to live on campus for the first three years. More than 75 per cent of the students also pursue volunteering opportunities, supporting the university’s mission, “knowledge in service to society”.

The most notable alumnus is Richard Nixon, the 37th president of the United States. He graduated from Duke University with a law degree in 1937. Duke alumni also head many Fortune 500 companies including Apple, Cisco Systems, JPMorgan Chase and PepsiCo.

Melinda Gates, who co-founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with her husband, also attended the university.

The alumni community also includes prominent novelists such as William Styron, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novelThe Confessions of Nat Turnerand also wroteSophie’s Choice, and Anne Tyler, who received the Pulitzer Prize forBreathing Lessons.

The university has an extensive private research library network, with three libraries on its West Campus, two on its East Campus, a library at the marine laboratory and separate libraries for business, divinity, law and medicine.",United States,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/duke-university
22,University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,"A public university founded in 1817, the University of Michigan had a rustic beginning. At its campus in Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, cows owned by the faculty once grazed, and as late as 1845, wheat was grown on site as part of a janitor’s remuneration.

By 1866, the university had become the largest in the country. Now, the University of Michigan is one of the biggest research universities in the United States. It boasts alumni including Gerald Ford, former US president; Larry Page, co-founder of Google; and actor James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader.

The university’s sporting tradition began in 1865, and its sports teams, collectively known as the Michigan Wolverines, have won more than 50 national championships in 12 sports. Why the wolverine became the university’s mascot is a mystery, as although the nickname caught on in the middle of the 19th century, the first verified sighting of the animal in Michigan state did not occur until 2004.

Michigan’s mission is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through “preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future”. It offers 250 undergraduate majors, 100 doctoral and 200 master’s programmes, as well as more than 1,400 student clubs.

The university has no shortage of bizarre traditions. On campus sits “The Cube”, a huge black object so finely balanced on one corner that students can spin it around despite its great weight. One myth is that the president gives it a push each morning in order to keep the campus running smoothly.

When students first arrive at Michigan they walk through a campus fountain to make them an “official wolverine”. After graduation, they walk the other way through the water, signifying their departure to join the professional world. And don’t step on the brass “M” at the centre of the campus, or exam failure awaits.",United States,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-michigan-ann-arbor

24,Northwestern University,"When it opened for business in 1855, Northwestern University had only two academic staff and 10 students. These were all male, but women have been admitted since 1869.

Northwestern owes its existence to the vision of its nine founders who, with no land, limited finances and little knowledge of higher education, determined to create a university for the vast Northwest Territory covering more than five of today’s states. They began planning in 1850 and, three years later, boldly went ahead and purchased a 379-acre site close to Lake Michigan and developed the campus at Evanston, named after a founder called John Evans.

From these small beginnings, Northwestern has developed into a leading private research university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence. It now consists of 12 separate schools and colleges and is notable for its research strength in fields including neuroscience, nanotechnology, biotechnology and the development of new drugs. The main campus is still based at Evanston, 10 miles north of Chicago, although there is a smaller one in Chicago, so students enjoy all the stimulus and opportunities for personal and professional development provided by one of the world’s great cities. Since 2008, there has also been a third, satellite campus in Doha, Qatar.

Northwestern’s mascot is Willy the Wildcat. Its mottoes are both taken from the New Testament and read, in Latin and Greek, “Whatsoever things are true” and “The world is full of grace and truth”.

Celebrated alumni include novelist Saul Bellow and economist George Stigler, who both went on to win Nobel Prizes, as well as Friends star David Schwimmer,Gone Girlauthor Gillian Flynn, and George R. R. Martin, whose novels inspired the Game of Thrones television series. No fewer than four economists and one chemist who worked as faculty at Northwestern went to receive Nobel Prizes. And the diplomat and political scientist Ralph Bunce, who had been a researcher there, went on to become the first African American to win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.",United States,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/northwestern-university
25,National University of Singapore,"As Singapore’s flagship university and among Asia’s best, theNational University of Singapore (NUS)offers a global approach to education, research and entrepreneurship, with a focus on Asian perspectives and expertise.

Our 17 faculties across three campuses in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram – provide a rigorous broad-based curriculum underscored by cross-faculty enrichment. We have pioneered many innovative academic programmes which include student exchange, entrepreneurial internships at12 NUS Overseas Colleges, as well as double, joint and concurrent degree programmes with some of the world’s best universities. Close to 40,000 students from 100 countries enrich our vibrant and diverse campus community.

The University’s multidisciplinary and real-world approach to education, research and entrepreneurship enables us to work closely with industry, governments and academia to address crucial and complex issues relevant to Asia and the world. Researchers in our faculties, 29 university-level research institutes, research centres of excellence and corporate labs focus on themes that include energy, environmental and urban sustainability; treatment and prevention of diseases common among Asians; active ageing; advanced materials; as well as risk management and resilience of financial systems. The University’s latest research focus is to use data science, operations research and cybersecurity to support Singapore's Smart Nation initiative.

26,New York University,"New York University (NYU) is one of the biggest private higher education institutes in the United States, and is highly regarded among American institutions.

Its history dates back to 1831, when the head of the US department of Treasury Albert Gallatin pushed forward the idea of establishing an easily accessible, innovative university in the most populous city in the US.

After almost two centuries of development, the institution became an academic centre that aims to set trends in global research and nurture talent from all the around the globe. It grants a significant amount to students in financial aid annually, in addition to generous funding for research.

The institution, which itself has a significant endowment, is perhaps most famously associated with its undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in social science, dentistry, nursing and fine arts.

With campuses on two continents from New York to Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, the university’s affiliates officially operate in 25 countries around the world. Locally, the university’s New York campus is formed of over 20 colleges and schools placed at 5 different locations in and around New York, such as Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn.

The main campus, located in the heart of Lower Manhattan in the vicinity of Sixth Avenue and Washington Square Park, covers 1 km² of land. It offers guaranteed housing options to freshmen, who may find themselves among the 11 thousand visitors who explore the Bobst library, one of the 11 libraries operated by NYU.

New York University’s alumni have received a number of Nobel and Crafoord Prizes, as well as several Pulitzer Prizes and Abel Prizes in the past.

After having the Violet for its official mascot for a century, the university introduced the Bobcat, an extinct species of big cat related to the puma. It symbolises the combination between the university’s academic achievement and success in sport activities.",United States,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/new-york-university
27,London School of Economics and Political Science,"The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is one of the foremost social science universities in the world, specialising in a wide range of social science disciplines, including economics, politics, sociology, law and anthropology.

It was founded in the late 1800s by Fabian Society members Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw for the purpose of bettering society, ‘by studying poverty issues and analysing inequalities.’

The philosopher Bertrand Russell taught there in 1895-96 and 1937-38, helping to define the LSE’s ethos. In 1900, it joined the federal University of London and has remained a member ever since, rapidly expanding to its current position near Aldwych in central London, where King George V laid the first stone of its 'Old Building' in 1920.

The LSE boasts associations with 16 Nobel Prize winners and counts 37 past or present world leaders among its alumni. Bertrand Russell received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, recognising his writing on ‘humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought’, while Mick Jagger attended as an undergraduate in 1961, dropping out after a year to form the Rolling Stones.

British Prime Minister Clement Attlee was an assistant lecturer there in 1912 and one of the first teachers in the new Department of Social Science and Administration. Lord Beveridge separately was appointed director of the LSE in 1937, later authoring the famousBeveridge Report, a cornerstone of the UK’s welfare state.

The LSE students’ union has twice courted controversy in the past half century, first in a series of riots in 1967 to protest the appointment of director Sir Walter Adams, who had worked as a principal in Zimbabwe under white rule. And again in 1989, when students elected Winston Silcott as their honorary president, after Silcott’s murder conviction (later overturned) during London’s infamous Broadwater Farm riot.

Today, the LSE is world-renowned. Home to 9,600 full time students from some 140 countries, it maintains international partnerships with Columbia University in New York, Sciences Po in Paris, Peking University in Beijing, the National University of Singapore and the University of Cape Town.",United Kingdom,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/london-school-economics-and-political-science
28,Carnegie Mellon University,"Located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private, global research university, and one of just 25 universities to be admitted to the World Economic Forum’s Global University Leaders Forum.

Its motto is ‘My heart is in the work’.

Established in 1900 by the famous industrialist Andrew Carnegie, initially as the Carnegie Technical Schools, the university became the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912. In 1967 it merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, resulting in its present incarnation.

CMU emphasises close collaborations between faculty and students to address scientific, technological and societal challenges, as well as making things ‘from art to robots’.

The university lays claim to many examples of ground-breaking inventions and pioneering research into brain science, data, start-ups and driverless cars, among others. It was the first institution (via professor Scott Fahlman in 1982) to create a ‘smile’ in an email.

Its cohort numbers well over 13,000 students from 114 countries, and a faculty of more than 1,400.

With its strong focus on creating new things, CMS says that many of its students go on to join some of the world’s most successful companies. The Association of University Technology Managers has ranked it first among US institutions for start-up companies created per research dollar spent, between 2008 and 2012.

As well as its US locations in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley, Carnegie Mellon has a campus in Doha, Qatar, and offers degree programmes in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America.

CMU boasts many student traditions with a distinctly Scottish flavour that owe their heritage to its Scottish-American founder, Andrew Carnegie. They include celebratory bagpipe playing on campus and the kilt-wearing student marching band known as the ‘Band Without Pants.’

=51,University of Manchester,"The University of Manchester is a place whereresearch has international impact, where students experience outstanding teaching and learning, transforming into employable graduates, and where all activity is enriched by acommitment to social responsibilityand the benefits we bring to society and the environment.

We were the first British university to set social responsibility as a core goal and in 2021 we were named the world’s number one university in theTimes Higher EducationUniversity Impact Rankings. Manchester topped the table of more than 1,100 universities from 94 countries on action taken towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Manchester was the first and most eminent of England’s civic universities. Ourrich heritageof discovery, social change and pioneering spirit remains at the heart of all we do. Today, we’re part of the prestigious Russell Group of UK universities, with a global reputation for the highest level of research and teaching, as demonstrated by our position in theTimes Higher EducationWorld University Rankings. In 2021 we were placed 51st in the world and eighth in the UK.

Manchester has a rich history of ground-breaking research and25 Nobel laureateshave studied or worked with us. This includes current members of academic staff, Professors Sir Kostya Novoselov and Sir Andre Geim, who shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics for the isolation of graphene’s properties.

Other pioneering discoveries include the work of Tom Kilburn, Freddie Williams and Alan Turing on the modern computer – the first stored program was run at Manchester – and the development of modern economics by trailblazers Sir John Richard Hicks and Sir William Arthur Lewis. The latter, on his appointment at Manchester, was Britain’s first Black professor. Manchester also led the way with the appointment of Baroness Jean McFarlane as the first Professor of Nursing in England. McFarlane, a pioneer within the field of healthcare, established the country’s first nursing degree.

Today, nearly half of our academic and research staff work on interdisciplinary research. Our fiveresearch beacons– advanced materials, cancer, energy, global inequalities and industrial biotechnology – are examples of how our cross-sector partnerships are helping to find unique solutions to some of the world’s biggest challenges.

Our place asone of the UK’s top research universitieswas confirmed in the results of the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutions. 83% of our research activity was judged to be ‘world-leading’ (4*) or ‘internationally excellent’ (3*), and we were ranked fifth in terms of research power. This environment is ideal for PhD students. Those who choose to undertake theirproject at Manchestercan collaborate with academics whose work is having global impact and access a dedicated enterprise centre and doctoral college committed to researcher development.

53,University of Southern California,"The University of Southern California opened for business in Los Angeles in 1880, when the city still lacked even basic amenities such as paving stones and electric light, and long before it became the glitzy capital of the movie industry. Although spearheaded by a judge called Robert Maclay Widney and a number of like-minded citizens, it took almost 10 years for their plans for a university in the region to come to fruition. It was eventually made possible by the donation of land from a diverse group of philanthropists: a Protestant horticulturist; an Irish pharmacist (and former governor of California); and a German-Jewish banker.

Although it initially welcomed only 53 students, USC has since grown into an internationally renowned research university and the largest private-sector employer in its city. Close to 4,000 faculty are now split between 21 separate schools and units. While the main campus can be found in the centre of Los Angeles, the three teaching hospitals and Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy are grouped together on a separate Health Sciences campus to the north east. Specialisms include cancer, stem cell, regenerative and sports medicine. Equally significant is the city children’s hospital staffed by USC’s Keck School of Medicine.

It was also the only public university to award degrees in the 18thcentury and is one of the original eight Public Ivy schools.

Today, UNC has 14 schools as well as the College of Arts and Sciences. It offers 78 bachelor’s degrees, 112 master’s degrees, 68 doctorate programmes and seven professional degree programmes. Its student population of almost 30,000 is taught by a faculty of more than 3,500. Nearly 90 per cent of classes have fewer than 50 students.

UNC has one of the highest study-abroad rates of any university in the US, with almost a third of its undergraduates studying in other countries before graduation. It has 325 programmes in 70 countries.

The UNC campus is located in the downtown area of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Spread over nearly 730 acres, it is informally divided into three separate areas: north campus (which includes most of the classrooms and some residence halls), middle campus and south campus.  There are also plans to build a new research park with expanded science facilities.

The university, with its Tar Heels teams, has a strong athletics programme and is a charter member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which was founded in 1953.

61,Brown University,"Founded in 1764, Brown is the seventh oldest university in the United States, and one of its most renowned higher education institutions. It is part of the Ivy League and, as an institution that prides itself on openness, was the first of the members to accept students from all religious affiliations.

Originally called the College of Rhode Island, Brown’s first home was Warren, Rhode Island before it relocated to College Hill, overlooking the state’s capital city Providence, in 1770. Some 34 years later, in recognition of a $5,000 gift from alumnus and leading Providence businessman Nicholas Brown, the university was renamed to reflect today’s title.

Today’s picturesque campus is made up of 230 buildings over 150 acres within walking distance of downtown Providence and close to the lively Thayer Street, Wickenden Street and Wayland Square where students and local residents mix, among ample shopping, dining and entertainment.

The university’s sports teams play under the name of the “Brown Bears”. Theodore Francis Green, a former Rhode Island governor and US senator, introduced a brown bear as the university’s mascot. Today, Bruno the Brown bear is still the university’s prime cheerleader.

A defining characteristic of the university was its introduction of the “Brown Curriculum”, which altered undergraduate education immeasurably at the institution. It was inspired by Francis Wyland, Brown’s fourth president, who argued that a student should have the freedom to “study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose”. The new “Open Curriculum”, which was launched in 1970, allowed students to develop their own core curriculum rather than be bound to a prescribed “liberal arts education”. It has defined Brown’s undergraduate experience to this day.

Besides study, Brown is a leading research institution. The university has connections to seven Nobel laureates including alumni Craig C. Mello and Jerry White who won for physiology or medicine and peace respectively, and current physics faculty member Leon Cooper. Fields Medal winner David Mumford is emeritus professor of applied mathematics at the university.

Brown’s diverse student body is exemplified by notable alumni from all walks of life. From the father of American education Horace Mann and The Office star John Krasinski, to Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark and financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, the university’s people are varied. Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, graduated from Brown in 2014, having transferred from the University of Oxford.",United States,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/brown-university

=101,Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) is a world-class institution of higher education that has existed for more than six centuries.  Since its founding as a royal Confucian academy in 1398 at the dawn of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), SKKU has demonstrated strong academic leadership.  Contemporary SKKU has embraced globalization and emerged as a leading university in Asia and the world.  In fact, SKKU actively encourages international collaboration through exchange of faculty and students, and the development of cutting-edge research and educational programs with its global partners.

The name “Sungkyunkwan” is synonymous with both tradition and innovation.  The literal meaning of the university’s name is, “An institution for building a harmonious society of enlightened human beings.”  The founding philosophy of Sungkyunkwan was needed in the past just as much as it is needed in today’s technologically advanced society.  The university’s faculty members are committed to quality teaching and research; offering students a challenging environment for intellectual and personal growth.

As the oldest university in East Asia and Korea’s top higher educational institution for centuries, Sungkyunkwan generated countless graduates that shaped the nation’s history and culture.  SKKU's motto, “Su-Gi-Chi-In”, which means “Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom”, teaches that the university’s students should strive to improve themselves and contribute to society.  This ideology is the fundamental principle by which the university has fostered so many influential leaders, thus contributing to the development of Korean society.  SKKU aims to educate future global leaders equipped with these essential values so that it will further contribute to the advancement of all of humanity.  Sungkyunkwan University continuously integrates its founding philosophy with modern technology in order to cultivate talented individuals capable of leading society into a brighter future.

Two Cities, Two Campuses

Seoul – The deep roots of SKKU are so strongly intertwined with Seoul that we cannot describe the university apart from the city.  Seoul is an ancient city that has existed for over two millennia.  Seoul’s architectural history has been carefully preserved to maintain a link between the city of yesterday and the thriving cosmopolitan megalopolis of today.  As the cultural, economic, and political center of the nation, Seoul provides infinite opportunities for discovery and excitement. University students reap the benefits of the city’s resources and are able to put into practice what they have learned in the classroom.

The campus is located inside the original city wall, which defined the boundaries of the old capital during Joseon Dynasty.  It is overlooking Changdeokgung, the UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most well preserved royal palace in Korea. Like Seoul, our university grew rapidly, and an expansion was needed to build the modern campus.  When expanding, the science programs were moved to Suwon and the humanities and social sciences programs remained at this campus.

Suwon – Being the capital of Gyeonggi Prefecture in Korea, Suwon is one of the most notable cities that has preserved the traditional beauty of the Joseon Dynasty.  Located 40 km south of Seoul, it is a center for business, education, and economic research, thanks to its proximity to major industrial complexes such as Samsung Digital City, the headquarters of Samsung Electronics.  Today, the city is well known for its stone fortress, Hwaseong, which was built in 1796 during the reign of King Jeongjo to guard the tomb of his father.

SKKU’s modern Natural Sciences Campus was established in Suwon in 1978.  It is accessible via shuttle bus and public transit in a little less than an hour.  When the new campus was built, the idea of a dual campus system was revolutionary in Korean higher education.  Some comprehensive universities located in big cities have tried to meet the need for expansion by founding a separate, usually smaller school in an outstanding rural area.

History of Sungkyunkwan: Over 600 Years of Academic Excellence

Sungkyunkwan was originally established by royal decree to promote Confucian scholarship.  As the nation’s primary source of political and academic leadership for so many years, Sungkyunkwan went through many vicissitudes with the country it served.  It would be misleading, however, to view the university merely in the context of its pre-modern history.  What the university has achieved in the past 50 years meets and exceeds that of the 500 years preceding our current century.

After the Korean War, and the emergence of the Republic of Korea, Sungkyunkwan underwent a renaissance as a private university.  As Korea modernized and underwent social and economic reforms, the university grew to address the diverse demands of the rapidly developing country.  Though a long history alone cannot guarantee the excellence of an institution, the rich culture emanating from SKKU’s heritage is a unique and valuable characteristic.

In addition, SKKU takes pride in its innovative spirit.  As a result of extensive effort to place the university’s engineering and science capabilities on an equal footing with its strong foundation in humanities, SKKU operates two campuses: The Humanities and Social Sciences Campus in Seoul and the Natural Sciences Campus 34 kilometers south in Suwon.  Since 1996, the university has been continuously developing and prospering due to a highly successful partnership with Samsung, which has generously funded several core initiatives.

Student Success and Future Value

SKKU is dedicated to ensuring each and every one of its graduates have a bright future.  That is why in 2019 its newly inaugurated president, Dr. Dong Ryeol SHIN, put forth the bold new objectives of promoting “Student Success” and providing “Future Value”.  Student Success is a new keyword for SKKU’s educational policies that emphasizes motivating, incentivizing, and aiding students through scholarships, counseling, and new dynamic academic programs, particularly in high-tech and convergent fields driving the fourth industrial revolution.   With this in mind, the University opened the first “Student Success Center” in Korea, held the first “Student Success Forum”, and awarded scholarships for achievements in the areas of research, extracurricular activities, volunteering, communication, globalization, and start-ups.

The concept of Future Value takes Student Success even further.  With the inception and dissemination of revolutionary technologies that are changing humanity and society, such as AI, big data, IoT, and more, SKKU is determined to produce skilled graduates well-versed in these and other important fields.  Future Value means providing students with the skills and opportunities they need to survive and thrive in an ever-advancing era.  This means the creation of convergent programs and research institutes as well as incorporating software and AI education, among other fields, into different unrelated areas to strengthen every SKKU student’s fundamental knowledge and abilities and ultimately have a successful future.

Global Leading University, SKKU

The results of Sungkyunkwan University’s innovation and effort can be seen in several objective indexes.  The number of students per full-time professor and the percentage of full-time professors are each 21.3 and 101.14%, which is the highest among Korea’s private universities.  Furthermore, the university has achieved a 231.2% total educational restitution rate which exceeded the national average of 116.6%.  SKKU had the highest employment rate among the 4-year universities of Korea with a rate of 68.3% last year.

SKKU had 5,275 publications last year and produced 576 patents.  The university was ranked number one in Korea in terms of SCI publications with an average of 0.8 per professor.  The amount of citations per paper was 5.1.  SKKU earned high acclaim as an “outstanding” institution, which is the highest ranking among the 85 universities in the Leaders in INdustry-university Cooperation (LINC) evaluation.  The income generated by technological transfer was last year was 5 million USD.

SKKU-Samsung Customized Partnership

Since Samsung Group partnered with the university, remarkable progress has been made thanks to Samsung-style management know-how.  Such close cooperation between the university and an industrial partner has allowed for significant developments aided by Samsung’s generous support.  Samsung has thus been able to steadily acquire qualified personnel while SKKU has made every effort to create a leading model of industry-university cooperation that will help attract talented students as well as develop further collaboration in Korea.   SKKU and Samsung currently manage 110 joint research projects, allowing students the chance to work for one the world's top companies.

Industry-University Cooperation

SKKU has created a strong academic-industrial foundation by expanding and reorganizing the research institutes within the school and building a cooperation system based on strong research abilities.  In addition, the Sungkyun Advanced Institute of Nano Technology (SAINT) and the Sungkyun Interfaculty Collaboration Center were established to promote convergence education between departments and research.  For this purpose, many research and education teams such as Future Nano Science Education and ICT Convergence Facility Administrative Education are receiving 6,840,000 USD in funding.  Also, the Faculty of Engineering is running a business team for nurturing specialists that have practical abilities and a deep understanding of materials.

To strengthen academic-industrial engagement, SKKU has recruited former executives who worked at companies as professors exclusively appointed for industry-university cooperation.  The assessment of professors was also changed from a quantitative evaluation to a differentiated assessment method that considers technology transfer and job creation.  As a result, Sungkyunkwan University has attained 450 billion KRW in research funding, which has increased significantly since 2010 when it was at 219.9 billion won.

Sungkyunkwan University is also reinforcing industry-university links.  SKKU, together with the Korean Government, opened the Grand ICT Research Center in Pangyo Techno Valley where 80,000 venture entrepreneurs are gathered.  The Grand ICT Research Center runs consortiums in various research areas such as intelligent ICT convergence and convergence software development with the university as well as enterprises by operating the Graduate school of Convergence.  Through this, Sungkyunkwan University is creating a hub to handle the development of new technologies, transfer of technology, and creation of patents which are all directly connected to business ventures.

International Network

As one of Korea’s most prestigious higher education institutions, Sungkyunkwan University discovered the importance of having a global presence early on.  SKKU is reinforcing the links between overseas universities to achieve its objective of generating creative global leaders in the era of internationalization.  SKKU has academic and research collaboration as well as student exchange programs with overseas institutions through its partnership agreements with around 700 international universities in 71 countries worldwide.  Furthermore, to offer various opportunities to SKKU’s students and to establish a global curriculum, the University has dual degree programs with many prestigious universities around the world.  Currently, SKKU is running 40 dual degree programs with partners including MIT Sloan School of Management, Indiana University Kelley School of Business, Nanyang Technological University, UNISINOS, Fudan University, Peking University, the University of Birmingham, and more.

=107,University of Birmingham,"Founded in 1900 on the vision set down by politician and statesman Joseph Chamberlain, the University of Birmingham prides itself on a longstanding tradition of innovation and progressive initiatives.

The university was a founding member of the National Union of Students, and the first in the country to be built on a campus model, incorporate a medical school and offer degrees in dentistry.

It was also the country’s first civic or ‘redbrick’ university, with students accepted regardless of their background or religion.

The modern university is home to 26,000 students, 5,000 of them international. With 31% of its academic staff also from overseas, Birmingham lays claim to one of the most diverse campuses in the UK and encourages a global outlook. Students can take advantage of a number of opportunities to internationalise their degree: around 450 undergraduates complete a year abroad as part of their course.

Birmingham’s main campus is located in the Edgbaston area of the city, where it houses the Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower (the world’s tallest free-standing clock), and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, which opened in 1939 and exhibits original work by Van Gogh, Picasso and Monet.

=107,RWTH Aachen University,"The RWTH Aachen University was founded in 1870 after Prince William of Prussia decided to use a donation to set up an institute of technology somewhere in the Rhine Province. Funding local banks and an insurance company meant that it was eventually located in Aaachen, so building work began in 1865 and doors opened to 223 students during the Franco-Prussian War. There was a strong focus on engineering and particularly the local mining industry.

As Germany’s westernmost important city, Aachen is situated at the heart of Europe and very close to the Dutch and Belgian border, so RWTH Aachen – or Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen – benefits greatly from a mix of cultures and languages. Although faculties of philosophy and medicine were introduced in the 1960s, it is still most famous for natural sciences and engineering – and, since 2014, has joined forces with the city to give a prestigious annual Engineering Award to a prominent figure in the field.

The university has always had strong ties with industry, creating a European equivalent of Silicon Valley around it, and attracted exceptional levels of external funding to its researchers. For its size, Aachen is the dominant German city for university spin-off companies and offices of engineering firms.

The world’s first wind tunnel and particle accelerator were both developed at RWTH Aachen. Major innovations created onsite include a pioneering aircraft made entirely of metal and a diesel soot filter.

In its strategy for 2020, RWTH Aachen makes clear its commitment to interdisciplinary research, which, along with diversity, internationalization and natural sciences, forms one of the four core themes of the work being carried out at its research park.

It was in the 1800s, however, that the university was officially founded, growing in size throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in line with the city of Bern’s own booming fortunes.

The university played a key role in the evolution of women's studies. Even in 1870, the the institution had a female student -Catharina Gontscharoff - registered. In 1899, the institution’s Female Students' Society was established, representing women's interests. Its motto was: ""Same Rights, Same Duties"".

The university has some prestigious former faculty members. Albert Einstein taught theoretical physics at Bern in 1908, and the following year the Russian philiospher Anna Tumarkin became a professor (and the first European lecturer to accept PhD students).

The University of Bern is not located on a single, main campus. Instead, its faculties and schools are based in the Länggasse area - a district net to the city centre known as the academic part of the town.

The institution has also obtained and repurposed other buildings in the area. Its Faculty of Theology (along with some other faculties), for example, is based in a former chocolate factory. Another former factory known as the vonRoll site is also to be turned into a university building, and will house the Department of Social Sciences.

It is a member of the C9 League, a group of leading higher education institutions which are often likened to the US Ivy League or the UK’s Russell Group, and which receive additional funding from the Chinese government.

The university is located in the city of the same name, in Jiangsu province, about 185 miles west of Shanghai.

It offers a range of multi-disciplinary courses, in areas such as the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering and management.

In total, Nanjing has 21 schools, running courses at undergraduate, postgraduate and research level. The university has one of China’s largest libraries, holding more than 4.5 million volumes.

These activities are spread across three campuses: in Gulou in the city centre; Pukou, on the northern bank of the Yangtze River; and the Xianlin international campus, to the east of the city.

The university claims to have played a central role in the development of Chinese politics and society.

A group of communists from Nanjing Higher Normal School, a forerunner of the modern institution, are credited with introducing the theory of Marxism to the Chinese general public in the early 1920s.

Scholars and students from the institution also played a key role in the country’s fight against Japanese occupation, and in the development of the modern Chinese state.

Nowadays the university has built links with higher education institutions around the world, and has set up several collaborative institutes, including the Centre for Chinese and American Studies, a partnership with Johns Hopkins University.",China,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/nanjing-university

Most undergraduate degrees at the university are taught in Swedish, although a few courses, mainly at postgraduate level, are taught in English.

Uppsala is a multi-campus university with sites that include the Biomedical Centre, one of Europe’s largest for life sciences, located on an old military base, and another on the island of Gotland, a UNESCO World Heritage site and popular Swedish holiday destination with miles of pristine beaches.

The university’s long history has given rise to a multitude of prominent scholars, including Carl Linnaeus, an 18th century Uppsala professor who created the system for classifying nature that’s still in use today, and Anders Celsius, an astronomy professor, who devised the Celsius temperature scale.

Eight Nobel Prize winners are associated with the university in total and its alumni include the IT entrepreneur Niklas Zennström, best known for founding Skype.

Uppsala is also famous for housing unique collections of cultural, artistic and scientific interest. Its various museums, including the Museum of Evolution and the Museum Gustavianum, situated in the university's oldest building, include artefacts dating back as far as the Viking period.

The university’s library is the largest in Sweden and its botanical gardens, which preserve an authentic 18th century environment, are the country’s oldest.

Its location, in Nashville, Tennessee – also known as ‘Music City, USA’ – is within walking distance of the city’s vibrant downtown area.

The university was built when shipping and rail magnate, ""Commodore"" Cornelius Vanderbilt, donated a $1 million endowment in 1873.

Its 330-acre campus has 120 centres and institutes, including the Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, the Bishop Joseph Johnson Black Cultural Center, and The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center, which was established to support the First Amendment and educate students on issues of freedom of speech.

The university has won three national championships and boasts a football stadium that seats over 40,000 people.

Intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed Commodores, after Vanderbilt’s nickname, and wear the black and gold of a sea captain. Their mascot is also a commodore figure who wears a sea captain’s hat and jacket.

Vanderbilt has its own hand sign, involving the extension of the thumb, index and middle fingers of the right hand to form a ‘V’ and a ‘U’ shape.

The oldest building date on campus dates back to 1859, while others are registered National Historic Landmarks. The Vanderbilt Dyer Observatory is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Though Vanderbilt was intended to be an all-male institution, this was never enforced, and women were admitted from 1875 onwards.

When a fire burnt down the university’s Kirkland Hall in 1905, the schoolchildren of Nashville collected pennies to pay for a replacement bell. That same 2,000-pound bell still chimes in the rebuilt Kirkland Tower, on the hour, every hour.

Established at the time of the Age of Enlightenment, the university, built on critical thinking and liberal values, expanded rapidly with many eminent scholars attending from across the whole of Germany.

By the 1930s, the Nazis had forced many Jewish intellectuals and dissidents to leave, and the wartime bombardment of Bonn that followed in 1944 led to the university’s destruction. In the post-war period, the university was rebuilt, students returned and its academics set about restoring the institution to its former glory.

Today, the University of Bonn is among the world’s leading research universities. It is home to more than 35,000 students and 4,500 academic staff, with strategic partnerships in place with 70 universities across the globe. Its strong international spirit is evident in its cohort of 4,000 international students, which, at about 12.5% of the student populace, is higher than the national average. Each year it confers approximately 800 PhDs.

The university cites subject strengths in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Economics, Biosciences, and Philosophy. Boasting two Nobel Prize winners: Wolfgang Paul in 1989 for Physics, and Reinhard Selten in 1994 for Economics, it also has associations with eight Leibniz Prize winners. Its most notable alumni include Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the composer Robert Schumann.

Penn State is one of the largest universities in the US.

It runs more than 160 undergraduate degree programmes and a similar number of postgraduate qualifications, while conducting more than $800 million-worth of research every year.

The majority of students are based on the main campus, University Park, located in the centre of the state, but many students begin their studies on another campus before transferring to the main site.

The university has two law schools, as well as the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, which treats more than 1 million patients every year.

The institution also operates Penn State World Campus, allowing students from around the world to study for the university’s qualifications online.

All this is a far cry from Penn State’s humble beginnings in 1855, when it was founded as the Farmers’ High School of Pennsylvania.

The institution gradually diversified its offering but did not gain university status in 1953, a move which was followed by a tripling of student numbers.

The university’s mascot is the Nittany Lion – referring to the mountain lions which are thought to have once roamed nearby Mount Nittany – and alumni take the same name.

It’s located in Charlottesville, Virginia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and bustling tourist centre just east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. In 2014, Charlottesville was named by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research as the ‘happiest city in America.’

The university is known for its student-run honours system, introduced in 1842 after a professor was shot and killed on campus. The honours system holds that students must not lie, cheat, or steal. Breaking any of these three rules may result in a trial before students, without any faculty present, and, if proved guilty, expulsion.

It is also renowned for its secret societies and many of the university’s 20,000-plus students are reputed to be members of societies that go by the names of ‘Seven’, ‘IMP’ and ‘Z’.

The Jefferson Literary and Debating Society, dating back to 1825, is the oldest continuously debating student society in the US and continues to meet at 7.29pm every Friday in Jefferson Hall, as it always has.

When Jefferson was designing the university, he placed a library, not a chapel (as was customary), at the centre of the institution to indicate a commitment to the pursuit of knowledge. In 1815, the newly-formed Library of Congress acquired Jefferson’s personal collection of 6,487 books on philosophy, science and literature.

The library still plays a central role in the life of the university, offering five million print volumes of books, 16 million manuscripts and home to a vast digital archive that works to preserve physical works, such as the Jefferson Papers, as well as rare video from the Civil Rights Era.

The University of Virginia has produced eight NASA astronauts, eight Pulitzer Prize winners and 51 Rhodes Scholars – the most from any state-supported university and the most in America’s South.

Truth, justice and freedom remain the university’s core values with these words imprinted on the university seal.

In the 1960s, the university was the site of several student protests and demonstrations. In 1990, German reunification brought about changes in the management of the university, and, with it, came a newfound focus on research.

Its alumni include two former US presidents: Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson; as well as several other heads of state, including King Felipe VI of Spain.

Having been founded in 1789 by John Carroll, the US’ first bishop and archbishop, on a hilltop overlooking the Potomac River, Georgetown awarded its first bachelor’s degrees in 1817.

The American Civil War nearly forced the closure of the university, with the student body dropping from 313 to 17 between 1859 and 1861, but it was in the aftermath of the conflict that Georgetown became the institution that is known today.

Patrick Healy, the university’s president between 1873 and 1882 and the first African American to earn a PhD, reshaped the institution’s curriculum to place a focus on history and the natural sciences, and started the construction of Healy Hall, the flagship Flemish Romanesque building at the heart of the campus.

Nowadays the university is divided into nine undergraduate and graduate schools, including Georgetown College, which offers a liberal arts programme, and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, which has educated heads of state and politicians from around the world.

With more than 7,000 undergraduate and about 10,000 postgraduate students, about 11 per cent of Georgetown’s students are from overseas, being drawn from about 130 countries.

Although it has always been independent of the Catholic Church, Georgetown’s Jesuit heritage continues to be influential, with education at the university emphasising service to others, particularly the vulnerable and disadvantaged.

Georgetown also runs a school of foreign service in Doha, Qatar, and offers study abroad opportunities at villas around the Mediterranean.

It was first established in 1897 when the Sheffield Medical School, Firth College and the Sheffield Technical School joined forces to create the University College of Sheffield. It became the University of Sheffield just 10 years later and founded on the penny donations of Sheffield factory workers who hoped a university would benefit their children, health and local economy.

Today the university teaches 25,000 students, including around 3,900 international students from 120 countries, and employs approximately 6,000 staff.

Its academic departments are divided into six faculties: arts and humanities, engineering, medicine, dentistry and health, science, social sciences, and international faculty, city college, Thessaloniki, Greece.

Its motto translates as ""To discover the causes of things"".

Sheffield can lay claim to five Nobel Prize winners among its alumni and faculty: Lord Florey for the 1945 Medicine / Physiology Prize, Sir Hans Krebs for the 1953 Medicine / Physiology Prize, Lord Porter for the 1967 Chemistry Prize, Richard Roberts for the 1993 Medicine / Physiology Prize, and Sir Harry Kroto for the 1996 Chemistry Prize.

Among its alumni are the authors Hilary Mantel and Lee Child, the 2012 Olympic gold-winner Jessica Ennis-Hill, chemist and first Briton in space Helen Sharman, and the first woman to fly solo from Britain to Australia, Amy Johnson.

Outside of the university itself, which ranks among the top in the UK for student experience, students at Sheffield can enjoy a thriving, cultural city with a reputation for being inexpensive.

=124,University of Arizona,"Predating the state from which it takes its name, the University of Arizona is a leading research institution located in the city of Tucson.

Funding for the university was allocated in 1885 – when Arizona was just a territory of the US, not a full state – in a step that was regarded as a poor deal by Tucson’s residents, who had hoped to receive the more lucrative appropriation to build a mental hospital instead.

Amid this reluctance, finding land for the university was a challenge, until two professional gamblers and a saloon keeper were persuaded to donate a patch of desert; allowing construction to begin in 1887, and classes to begin in 1891.

Since then, the university has expanded to cover more than 380 acres of central Tucson, with much of the campus having been designated as an arboretum because of the rare trees that it holds. Almost all of the university’s buildings are characterised by the use of red bricks, particularly in facades.

The university is divided into a number of colleges, and boasts two medical schools, as well as the Banner-University Medical Center, which is rated as one of the best hospitals in the US.

Among the colleges is the University of Arizona Honors College, which aims to provide an experience similar to a liberal arts college, with more than 4,500 students.

The university is home to seven libraries and nine museums, including the Arizona State Museum and Biosphere 2, described as a “world under glass”, holding a living rainforest and an “ocean” in glass domes.

The university is renowned for its research impact, and a particular research strength is space science, with the institution claiming to have been awarded more Nasa grants than any other university in the US.

Overall, the university receives more than $580 million (£402 million) in research funding every year. In turn, through knowledge transfer and technology parks, the university estimates that it supports $8.3 billion of economic activity in Arizona every year.

Sports teams and alumni of the university are known as “Wildcats”, and the institution’s motto is “Bear Down, Arizona” – the last words of revered American football quarterback John “Button” Salmon, in 1926.

Notable alumni of the university include late US presidential candidate Barry Goldwater,Sesame Streetco-creator Joan Ganz Cooney, and Nobel prizewinning astrophysicist Brian Schmidt.

=124,Rice University,"Rice University is an intimately sized research university in the heart of Houston, Texas, with a focus on undergraduates and a reputation for unconventional thinking.

Edgar Odell Lovett , the first president of Rice, said “[We must] keep the standards up and the numbers down”, and even today there are only a few thousand students.Lovett introduced a college system whereby students and faculty would live, eat and learn in the same environment.

Over 70% of undergraduates and nearly all first year students live on the 300-acre campus and everybody is a member of one of 11 co-ed colleges. There are no sororities or fraternities and students of different majors and ages live together.

Rice has eight schools of Architecture, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Business, Music, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences, with an undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio of 6 to 1 and a median undergraduate class size of 14.

Since Rice’s inception, exams have not been proctored as students are trusted not to cheat.

Rice’s history dates back to 1891 when businessman William Marsh Rice created a charter for the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, which required that the institute would begin only after his death.

In 1900 he was murdered by his valet, who planned and failed to inherit his estate using a forged will, and in 1912 the institute was born with 77 students, including women, and 12 members of faculty.

Research is not just for faculty members, as over half of the university’s undergraduates also take part, and Rice has been instrumental in the creation of nanotechnology, artificial hearts and Buckyballs.

Rice alumni include several US Congressmen and Cabinet Secretaries, nine astronauts, nine Major League Baseball players, two Nobel Laureates and four fictional literary characters.

The university has a tradition of elaborate practical jokes, the most famous being in 1988 when three engineers, three scientists and an English major developed a successful plan to rotate the university’s 2,000 pound statue of William Marsh Rice by 180 degrees.

Rice’s many wacky rituals include the Beer Bike intramural race and drinking competition dating from the opening of the residential colleges in 1957.

126,City University of Hong Kong,"Since CityU's establishment as a university in 1994, a rich range of factors has contributed to our success as one of the world's most dynamic young universities in terms of nurturing excellent graduates and developing research that directly benefits society.

The quality of our research and teaching, as well as the employability of our graduates and the strengths of our individual areas of specialisation, strongly positions us in a number of international surveys.

As a visionary hub for professional education and problem-driven research with a special focus on One Health, Digital Society, Smart City, Matter and Brain, CityU has a mission to respond to societal and technological change. Hong Kong’s first and only veterinary college, which the University established in collaboration with Cornell University in the US, pioneers excellence in veterinary education and research. Hong Kong’s first School of Data Science meets the demand for data scientists and engineers for the data-driven economy of the future.

Led by internationally renowned academics and supported by first-rate facilities, CityU aims to generate new knowledge and create innovative products and solutions that address pressing world problems and improve people’s quality of life.

Our Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study adds an impressive intellectual dimension to campus activities, marking a new phase in the promotion of innovative research in strategic areas by world-leading scholars, Nobel laureates and academicians.

Research is also boosted by the expertise collected at our various research centres. Two State Key Laboratories are housed at CityU, one for Terahertz and Millimeter Waves and one for Marine Pollution, and one Chinese National Engineering Research Center: the Hong Kong Branch of National Precious Metals Material Engineering Research Center. These prestigious facilities enrich the context in which our research projects can develop.

Our education philosophy encourages each student to make an original discovery with support via state-of-the-art technology, funding and learning spaces. Our unique curriculum immerses young people in the processes that lie behind every discovery and innovation, producing the critical skills needed for today's globalised job market.

Our burgeoning global presence has stimulated a drive towards internationalisation. Thousands of CityU students head overseas for exchanges every year. To help develop a greater understanding among our students of the world's diverse cultures and environments, we aim to enable 65% of them to join an overseas exchange, and thanks to community support and donations, we are getting close to this target.

Our momentum looks set to continue as we expand our campus, building more space for research laboratories and for collaborative learning opportunities, and making CityU a truly exciting place in which to study and research.

What makes studying at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) so unique is the strong emphasis that we place on discovery and innovation. Our unique curriculum enables students to pursue original research projects during their undergraduate studies. The rationale is that in today’s highly competitive job market and against a backdrop of rapid technological advancements, young people today need to understand the processes embedded in the discovery process. This approach is deliberately designed to seek innovative ways to generate knowledge.

To facilitate this endeavour, we firmly believe that teaching and research should be integrated, i.e. that our faculty should be adept at teaching and research, rather than researchers only researching, and teachers only teaching. Our students benefit because they learn about cutting-edge ideas from highly rated faculty, and our faculty benefit by interacting closely with students on their projects.

Our capacity to break new ground is exemplified by our pioneering work in a range of areas. For example, at the start of the 2019/20 academic year, we welcomed our first cohort of government-funded undergraduates studying on our ground-breakingbachelor’s degree in veterinary medicine, the first of its kind in the region and a collaboration with Cornell University, one of the premier institutions in the world for training in this field. No other institution in Hong Kong has developed such ambitious plans to introduce veterinary medicine.

Other firsts that make CityU stand out include establishing theSchool of Creative Mediaabout twenty years ago when the field was relatively unknown, and setting up Hong Kong’s only and firstSchool of Energy and Environment, two critically intertwined disciplines that are of such importance today.

In July 2018, we launched the School of Data Science and the Hong Kong Institute for Data Science, two initiatives that are firsts for Hong Kong, to acknowledge the increased global demand for highly qualified data scientists and engineers.

If you wish to know more about ourother colleges and schools,click here.

The glue holding together all these initiatives is a dedication to globalising our students’ outlook by learning from international scholars who hail from a number of countries and regions, from the US and Canada to Europe and other countries in Asia, contextualising learning beyond the local and the regional, and, crucially, offering international exchange opportunities for students. Through our vast network of friends, collaborators and supporters around the world, we pledge to support such exchanges for about 65% of our undergraduate population. We have around 400 partner institutions in more than 40 countries and regions, and the majority of our students relish the chance to experience such a choice of cultures, languages and learning styles, all of which have a profound impact on a young person’s intellectual and social development.

Meanwhile, to enrich the overall campus experience, CityU loves the arts and sports! We have an annual arts festival that champions our student musicians, actors, dancers and singers, and our new exhibition gallery hosts regular events, such as the stellar presentation about the “Leonardo da Vinci: Art & Science. Then & Now” exhibition, aimed at bringing art to life on campus. And our sports teams are second to none. CityU had notched up a record-breaking 9th Grand Slam win in the local intervarsity sports competitions, while several of our athletes represent Hong Kong and have been voted Most Valuable Player over the years.

To assist students keen to study with us, a range of scholarships is available for outstanding students in academic or non-academic areas. Thesescholarships,for local and non-local students, can cover tuition fees, living costs and exchanges.

The best for the best

At CityU we give academics the support needed for high-quality research projects to blossom and meet their potential. We are very aware that the best scholars are highly sought after by world-class institutions, which is why we strive to create an atmosphere on campus that is wholly conducive to bringing to life ground-breaking ideas and finding the optimum means to making sure projects get the support they deserve.

We start by making sure that all our faculty members in ourfive colleges and five schoolsknow exactly what is expected of them in terms of teaching and research. Research is supported by a suite of grants, schemes and programmes aimed at kick-starting the careers of younger faculty members and nurturing the research agenda of more established scholars. Mentoring is one of our many strengths, and department heads and senior faculty are well versed in helping new recruits to navigate their way through the list of funding avenues in Hong Kong, mainland China and further afield.

We provide a great deal of input into ensuring that the quality of teaching at the university level is of world-class standard. In fact, CityU is the only university to have won teaching awards sponsored by the Hong Kong government on four separate occasions. We are also highly diverse. Our international faculty accounts for approximately 70% of the total number, who come from about 35 countries and regions. Their rich backgrounds add a great deal to campus life.

In addition, our regular orientation workshops provide a comprehensive overview of matters as diverse as PhD supervision, successful grant applications, our undergraduate curriculum, and our commitment to outcome-based teaching and learning.

In essence, CityU is a dynamic, fast-growing university that is pursuing excellence in research and professional education. We want the best faculty to join us from wherever they are based in the world, and we understand that to attract, and retain, such talent, we need to guarantee a work-place environment that excites and sustains.

And of course, a vital part of working at CityU includes our students, and they never fail to impress. Local and non-local students alike are thriving, taking full advantage of the opportunity to pursue their own research ideas during their studies, and through our extensive exchange programmes, they are fully immersing themselves in multicultural activities across the world.

=127,University of Oslo,"The University of Oslo (UiO) was established in 1813. It was Norway’s first university, founded when the city after which it is named was still just a provincial town called Christiania. Since then it has made academic breakthroughs in law, science (especially maritime science) and played a key role in Norway's liberation from Denmark.

UiO’s original campus is located in the heart of the city, next to the royal palace and parliament. Its main Blindern campus is a subway ride from there, close to forested hills and offering views of Oslo Fjord.

In 1933, an astronomical observatory was built, still standing to this day, and from 1913-1989 it was home to Norway's national library.

The university constitutes Norway’s largest research institution comprising eight faculties: Theology, Law, Medicine, Humanities, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Dentistry, Social Sciences, and Education. It offers over 800 courses, all taught in English, with 40 Master’s degree programmes also taught in English.

UiO is home to its own museum of cultural history, housing three Viking ships including the best preserved and first ever excavated. Since the university’s founding it has also prided itself on being an 'elite school' for upper secondary school teachers.

Five Nobel Laureates are associated with the university. They include chemist Odd Hassel, economist Ragnar Frisch and Ivar Giæver, an electrical engineer who worked on electron tunnelling and biophysics.

Jens Evensen, a former student of the university and an expert in international law, is responsible for much of Norway's sovereign wealth. He formulated the sentence, ‘The right to subsea natural resources lies with the state,’ which allowed the country to lay claim to the natural resources along its coastline.

Established in 1737, the university – informally known as Georgia Augusta – is home to about 26,000 students, 11% of who are international.

A research-led university, Göttingen has associations with over 40 Nobel Prize winners, including physicists Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck and Otto Stern. The Brothers Grimm both taught at Göttingen and its alumni includes the statesman Otto von Bismarck, philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, poet Heinrich Heine and sociologist Max Weber.

Napoleon once said of Göttingen that it belonged ‘to the whole of Europe.' It was founded by England's King George II in his capacity as Elector of Hanover, and the university’s library, founded in 1734, was the first comprehensive academic library of European standing.

In the first part of the twentieth century, Göttingen was regarded as the centre of the mathematical world – a position it lost in 1933 when more than 50 of its faculty were forced to leave the University under Nazi rule.

After World War II, Göttingen was the first university in Germany to resume teaching, going on to become one the largest higher education institutions in the country.

The modern Göttingen offers a wide range of degree programmes, particularly in the humanities, with almost all academic disciplines represented across its 13 faculties. It prioritises creativity, in particular, with students and faculty encouraged to engage in creative thinking as well as acquiring methodological knowledge.

The university’s profile is further enhanced by its partnerships with several local research partners, including the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, the German Aerospace Centre and five Max Planck Institutes, which work with the university to provide an alliance of collaboration in research and teaching.

=152,University of Florida,"The University of Florida can trace its origins back to the very start of publicly funded higher education in the state. In 1853, shortly after Governor Thomas Brown passed a bill offering financial support, a man called Gilbert Kingsbury opened the East Florida Seminary. This eventually merged with the former Florida Agricultural College, the St Petersburg Normal and Industrial School and the South Florida Military College in 1905 to become the new University of the State of Florida. The relevant legislation was known as the Buckman Act and its originator, Henry Holland Buckman, is honoured in the university’s Buckman Hall.

Major developments soon followed. In 1906, the Florida Museum of Natural History was incorporated into UF. As well as being invaluable for teaching and research, this represented a commitment to the study of biological diversity still significant almost a century later in 2000, when the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity was established as one of the largest collections of butterflies and moths in the world. In 1909, president Albert Murphree reorganised the separate colleges under a single mission and greatly expanded the size of the institution, with an annual intake rising from 200 to over 2,000.

Major developments in the 20th century include the creation of the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing in 1956 and a teaching hospital two years later. By building on these, UF is now the only university in the country which incorporates six different healthcare colleges on a single campus. A different landmark was reached in 1968, when the first ever “Gator” took part in the Olympics.

Since the millennium, the university has remained at the forefront of research in many areas, often through high-profile international collaborations. In 2002, it led a consortium of seven universities which secured a $15 million grant from NASA to carry out space research. From 2008, a partnership with Zhejiang University in China worked on sustainable energy. In 2012, over 30 UF physicists, postdocs and students played a leading part in the team whose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider established that the elusive Higgs boson really existed.

=158,University of Nottingham,"The University of Nottingham is a public research university in the UK city of Nottingham.

The city’s first civil college opened in 1881 and its foundation stone was laid by the then Prime Minister, WE Gladstone.

By 1928 it had outgrown its original building and moved to what is today the university’s main campus. It wasn’t until 1948 that the college was awarded the Royal Charter, allowing it to officially become the University of Nottingham and award degrees in its own name.

Since its inception, the university has emphasised innovation. In 1970 it founded the UK’s first 20th century Medical School, and in 1995 the School of Nursing – a result of the university merging with the Mid-Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery.

In 2000 the university opened a campus in Malaysia. Five years later it opened another, a new purpose-built park campus near Kuala Lumpur. In 2006, Nottingham became the first foreign university to be invited to establish an independent campus in Ningbo, China, a historic city close to Shanghai.

Worldwide, the university has a student cohort of over 40,000 who between them represent more than 150 countries. Through its various study abroad programmes, most students have the opportunity to study overseas as part of their degree, in countries that include Sweden, Mexico, Japan, New Zealand and the US.

Over the years, the University of Nottingham has taught a number of outstanding students who have gone on to become Nobel prize winners, leading scientists, politicians, novelists and Olympic gold medallists. They include the novelist DH Lawrence, the sixth Prime Minister of Malaysia Dato Seri Najib Razak, and former head of the secret intelligence service Sir John Sawers.

Today, the university is home to five faculties: Arts, Medicine and Health Sciences, Science, Engineering and Social Sciences.

Nottingham is known for having a vibrant social scene and is home to a students’ union that supports an eclectic range of organisations, societies, student groups, campaigns and community projects.

Officially founded in the early 20th century, the university’s origins can be traced back to the 19th century, when the Yorkshire College of Science was established. It was one of the first colleges in the UK for students of all faiths and backgrounds, set up to challenge the exclusivity of Oxford and Cambridge.

Initially the college focussed purely on scientific studies before eventually introducing Classics, History and Modern Literature. This led the Yorkshire College of Science to become the Yorkshire College and in 1904, King Edward VII granted Leeds its own Charter as an independent institution.

Today, the University of Leeds is among the Russell Group of research-intensive universities. It offers over 500 undergraduate and more than 200 postgraduate-degree courses. Teaching staff have been awarded 26 National Teaching Fellowships – more than any other university in the UK.

With over 30,000 students – 5,000 of them international, from more than 100 countries – the university prides itself on being a multicultural and international institution.

Its partnership with Southwest Jiaotong University in Chengdu, China was the first overseas school to be set up by the University of Leeds and offers students a unique UK-Chinese engineering curriculum.

The university is located on a single-site campus, just a short walk from Leeds’ vibrant city centre, with access to art galleries, museums, shopping and sports facilities, as well as green spaces.

Leeds University Union offers over 250 clubs and societies and its students' union was the first in the UK to be awarded ‘excellent’ status by the National Union of Students (NUS) as part of its Quality Students' Unions accreditation scheme.

=170,University of Antwerp,"The roots of the University of Antwerp (UA) date back to 1852 with the establishment of the State School for Economics and the Saint Ignatius School of Economics – two commercial institutes with a focus on business.

Both institutes were granted university status by the Belgian government in the 1960s and became Faculties for Economic Science. The Jesuit Saint Ignatius School gradually expanded to offer courses in arts, law and social sciences and by the 1970s, a third institute was founded to provide post-graduate and PhD programmes in Belgium’s second largest city.

All three institutions began operating as a confederation under the University of Antwerp banner and finally became the university it is today in 2003.

Today, UA is home to 20,000 students, of which about 18 per cent come from overseas with 132 countries represented through the student body. Working at the university are over 5,000 employees, including 3,000 tenured researchers and almost 700 professors.

The university is organised across nine faculties, including Economics, Engineering, Arts, Design Sciences, Law, Medicine, Pharmaceutical, Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, and Social Sciences.

It offers 33 undergraduate degree programmes, 69 master’s and 18 ‘master-after-master programmes’. A total of 31 programmes are taught in English and the university prides itself on engendering an entrepreneurial approach.

There are nine campuses of the university that are spread throughout the diverse city of Antwerp, from the historic city centre to what is called the ‘green belt’ to the south.

Each year, the university publishes around 3,650 scientific publications. It cites research strengths in drug discovery and development, ecology and sustainable development, infectious diseases, neurosciences, socio-economic policy, and urban history and policy.",Belgium,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-antwerp

=187,George Washington University,"Founded in 1821 by an Act of Congress, George Washington University says that it “makes history”. It was George Washington himself who envisioned a university in the United States capital in his last will and testament, to serve as an intellectual hub for the entire country.

It boasts three campuses – Foggy Bottom, Mount Vernon and the Virginia Science and Technology campus – so close to the heart of power that parts of the university are just a four-block walk to the White House, not to mention many other governmental and private agencies, providing huge internship and job opportunities for students.

The university’s graduates have helped shape US history: it counts five Supreme Court justices among its alumni. Politicians Colin Powell and John Foster Dulles, as well as former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and former first lady Jackie Kennedy also went to George Washington.

George Washington was the backdrop to several momentous events in 20th-century history. In 1939, a conference on campus revealed that Otto Hahn had successfully split the atom; while in 1981, the university hospital treated Ronald Reagan after an attempted assassination.

But the university is not just about politics. George Washington boasts a thriving arts scene, with several student dance groups, improvisation and theatre clubs, art galleries, as well as instrumental and voice ensembles.

The university’s Lisner Auditorium has hosted appearances ranging from Betty White and Al Gore to Salman Rushdie. It has a wide range of fine art, music, theatre and dance scholarships on offer to freshmen.

Based in Washington, students have access to some of the finest libraries, museums and arts venues in the country. It also has a strong athletic tradition, stretching back to the late 19th century.

The university launched collegiate basketball in 1906, just as the sport was in its infancy. George Washington also has an impressive record in soccer, baseball and athletics.

There are no fewer than six busts of George Washington himself on campus, and the university colours of buff and blue are those the general wore into battle.

It has two mascots: an official namesake mascot called George, completed with powdered wig and tricorne hat; and an unofficial hippo mascot, which appears around campus and at events.",United States,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/george-washington-university
=187,Technical University of Denmark,"The Technical University of Denmark dates its history back to 1829, when it was founded by H.C. Ørsted, the father of electromagnetism, and its graduates played a major role in the rise of Danish engineering. It is now bills itself as one of the leading engineering universities in Europe, and teaches the subject at bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral levels.

Research at the university focuses on the physical sciences – including chemistry, biotechnology and physics – as well as on certain industries such as agriculture, management, transport and construction. The university says it is particularly focused on “usefulness to society, relevance to business, and sustainability”.

When it comes to studying, the “Scandinavian way” pervades how students are taught, the university says. Students are encouraged take responsibility for their projects, and there is also a “refreshing lack of hierarchy” and relatively informal relationships between academics and students. Professors are known by their first names, as in Denmark, respect is earned, rather than coming from wealth, job or car size. But don’t be late – even a delay of a few minutes is considered “quite rude”, according to the institution.

The university’s main campus is at Lyngby, around 15 km north of Copenhagen. It was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s when it needed more space, and now boasts more than 100 buildings. The campus was designed by a famous Danish architect couple, Eva and Nils Koppel. There are also other university outposts in Ballerup, northwest of Copenhagen, and at Risø, which sits on one of Denmark’s fjords and specialises in finding sustainable energy solutions.",Denmark,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/technical-university-denmark
=187,Yonsei University (Seoul campus),"Yonsei University, established 132 years ago as the first modern higher educational institution in Korea, emerged to play a crucial role in educating and cultivating leaders needed for Korea's economic development and industrialization. Its main campus lies in the heart of Seoul, while the International Campus, established in 2010 mainly for the education of freshmen, is located in Songdo, Incheon. Its scenic campus had been broadcast internationally as ""one of the most beautiful campuses in the world."" The Yonsei International Campus represents a new education paradigm in Asia with the Residential College system and integrated curriculum.

Yonsei University aims to nurture students with capacity for creativity, empathy, and self-motivation. To fulfill this educational goal, the University introduced educational experiments with three main purposes: to cultivate creativity in global-minded students, to promote ""learning by doing"" through experience-based education, and to implement digital learning by building a Smart Campus (S-Campus). For these purposes, Yonsei University designed various interdisciplinary majors to ensure the training of creative future talents. All students from a wide variety of majors live and communicate with each other, thereby naturally leading to knowledge convergence among disciplines and cultivation of the ability to empathize with others. In addition, the S-Campus built an integrated digital infrastructure to support various student-led educational practices.

Yonsei University faculty members have published extensively in international research publications across all academic fields, thus leading the way to the future. The University not only produces distinguished scholars from its global-minded student body but also invites world renowned professors to teach and participate in joint research projects, including Nobel laureates such as Randy Schekman and Eric Maskin. Recently, Yonsei University welcomed another special advisor in order to actively contribute to the sustainable development of humankind. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joined Yonsei University to complete his life-long career objective by achieving the sustainable development goals adopted during his term at the UN. With these initiatives, Yonsei University will continue to enhance its social and global contributions and engagements in teaching, research, and public services.",South Korea,https://web.archive.org/web/20210602120510/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/yonsei-university-seoul-campus
