Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/massachusetts-institute-technology-mit,1,North America,United States,2,"“Mind and Hand” is the thought-provoking motto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, known also as MIT. This motto enigmatically encapsulates this famous institution’s mission to advance knowledge in science, technology and areas of scholarship that can help to make the world a better place.

At its founding in 1861, MIT was initially a small community of problem-solvers and science lovers eager to bring their knowledge to bear on the world. Today, MIT has evolved into an educational behemoth, with some 1,000 faculty members and more than 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students.

MIT is an independent, coeducational, privately endowed university organized into five schools (architecture and planning; engineering; humanities, arts, and social sciences; management; science) and one college (computing). Yet the principle of educational innovation remains at the core of MIT’s educational philosophy.

MIT researchers are at the forefront of developments in artificial intelligence, climate adaptation, HIV, cancer, and poverty alleviation, while in the past MIT research has fuel led scientific breakthroughs such as the development of radar, the invention of magnetic core memory and the concept of the expanding universe.

Science and technology are not the only strings to MIT’s bow, however. Approximately 20 percent of MIT undergraduates join a sports team, and with 33 varsity sports MIT boasts one of the broadest intercollegiate athletic programs in the world.

A vibrant arts culture also permeates college life. There are 12 museums and galleries on campus, with the MIT Museum drawing nearly 125,000 visitors each year. Students participate in more than 60 music, theatre, writing and dance groups, and faculty members of MIT even include Pulitzer Prize winners and Guggenheim fellows.

MIT is set in 168 acres of grounds that extend for more than a mile along the Cambridge side of the Charles River basin. The campus features stunning landmarks designed by the likes of architects Al var Aalto, Frank Gehry, and Steven Hollin, as well as buildings in a range of architectural styles, from neoclassical to modernist and brutalist.

At its edges, the campus merges with various Cambridge neighborhoods, including Kendall Square which is one of the most innovative square miles on the planet. The close association of industry and research has helped MIT alumni go on to launch more than 30,000 active companies, creating 4.6 million jobs and generating roughly $1.9 trillion in annual revenue. No wonder then that a nation of MIT graduates would be equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world."

Stanford University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/stanford-university,3,North America,United States,1,"Stanford University is a place of discovery, creativity, innovation and world-class medical care. Dedicated to its founding mission of benefiting society through research and education, Stanford strives to create a sustainable future for all, catalyze discoveries about ourselves and our world, accelerate the societal impact of its research, and educate students as global citizens. More than 7,000 undergraduate and 9,000 graduate students pursue studies at Stanford each year.

The university is located in the San Francisco Bay Area on the ancestral land of the Muwekma Oh lone Tribe and first welcomed students in 1891. Covering 8,180 acres, Stanford has one of the largest university campuses in the US, with 18 interdisciplinary research institutes and seven schools: the Graduate School of Business; School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences; Graduate School of Education; School of Engineering; School of Humanities and Sciences; Law School; and School of Medicine.

Stanford University was founded in 1885 by California senator Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, to “promote the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization”. The couple’s only child had died of typhoid, and their decision to build a university on their farm was intended as a memorial. From the start the university was non-sectarian, co-educational and affordable, teaching both the traditional liberal arts and the technology and engineering that was shaping the new America at the time.

Fast forward more than a century, and Stanford counts 20 Nobel laureates within its community and is regularly ranked among the top three universities in the world. Nicknamed “The Farm” from the days when horses roamed there, Stanford’s campus is now home to a rich and diverse student life, with over 625 organized student groups.

Sport is popular, with students, faculty and staff enjoying state-of-the-art recreational facilities and wellness programs. Stanford offers 36 varsity and 33 club sports, as well as physical education academic classes, fitness and wellness, aquatics, intramurals, and adventure programming. Sports teams are referred to as the “Stanford Cardinal.”

Stanford also has a rich tradition of fostering creativity and the arts: there is a vibrant campus arts district and two world-class museums which host regular exhibitions. Eight dining halls, a teaching kitchen and organic gardens provide the campus community with healthy, sustainable meals."
University of Oxford,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-oxford,4,Europe,United Kingdom,0,"The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and is actually so ancient that its founding date is unknown – though it is thought that teaching took place there as early as the 11th century.

It’s located in and around the medieval city center of Oxford, dubbed “the dreaming city of spires” by the 19th century poet Matthew Arnold, and comprises 44 colleges and halls as well as the largest library system in the UK.

There are 22,000 students at Oxford in total, around half of whom are undergraduates, while 40 per cent are international students. A quarter of the city of Oxford’s residents are students, giving the city the youngest population in the UK.

The University of Oxford does not have a main campus, its buildings and facilities instead being scattered around the medieval city center. Its colleges each have a distinctive character and traditions often dating back centuries. Colleges are self-governing institutions to which students usually apply directly. There are four academic divisions within Oxford University: Humanities, Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; and Social Sciences. The university’s particular strength is the sciences, and it is ranked number one in the world for medicine.

Oxford is a youthful and cosmopolitan city with plenty to see and do. There are dozens of historic and iconic buildings, including the Bodleian Libraries, Ashmolean Museum, Sheldonian Theatre, the cathedral, and the colleges themselves.

Students can choose to spend their time studying or avail themselves of the many extracurricular activities available. There’s a strong musical life at Oxford, with clubs and societies spanning all genres, from jazz, through to classical and folk. Oxford is also ranked highly for sport, with its top rowers taking part every year in the world-famous boat race with the University of Cambridge on the River Thames. Drama lovers are also well catered for, with one of the largest and most vibrant university drama scenes in the country.

Oxford has an alumni network of over 250,000 individuals, including more than 120 Olympic medalists, 26 Nobel Prize winners, seven poets laureate, and over 30 modern world leaders (including Bill Clinton, Aung San Suu Kyi, Indira Ghandi and 26 UK Prime Ministers).

It has a friendly rivalry with Cambridge for the title of best university in the UK and is regularly ranked as being one of the top three universities in the world. Notable Oxford thinkers and scientists include Tim Berners-Lee, Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins."
Harvard University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/harvard-university,5,North America,United States,1,"Established in 1636, Harvard is the oldest higher education institution in the United States, and is widely regarded in terms of its influence, reputation, and academic pedigree as a leading university in not just the US but also the world.

Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, three miles north-west of Boston, Harvard’s 209-acre campus houses 10 degree-granting schools in addition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, two theaters, and five museums. It is also home to the largest academic library system in the world, with 18 million volumes, 180,000 serial titles, an estimated 400 million manuscript items and 10 million photographs.

Like most of the United States’ pr e-civil War colleges, Harvard was founded to train clergy, but Harvard’s curriculum and student body quickly secularized, and in the 20th century admissions policy was opened up to bring in a more diverse pool of applicants.

Now, a total of 21,000 students attend the university, each of whom at some point can be seen bustling past the famous statue of John Harvard, the university’s first benefactor and founder, which looks on benignly in the center of the campus. The bronze statue’s gleaming foot is due to almost incessant rubbing by tourists and students, who believe the act brings good luck.

Only the academic elite can claim a place at Harvard, and the nominal cost of attendance is high – though the university’s hefty endowment is such that it can offer generous financial aid packages, which around 60 per cent of students take advantage of.

As freshmen, students live in one of the dormitories in Harvard Yard, a prime location, and eat in the historic and picturesque Annenberg dining hall. Harvard students are active around and beyond campus, with over 400 official student societies including extracurricular, co-curricular and athletic opportunities. Whether playing on the field in Harvard Stadium, fostering entrepreneurial activities at the Harvard innovation lab or writing and editing at the daily newspaper the Harvard Crimson, student life is a rich and rewarding experience.

Harvard\'s alumni include eight US presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars. Whether it be Pulitzer Prizes, Nobel Prizes, or Academy Awards, Harvard graduates have won them. Students and alumni have also won 108 Olympic medals between them. The university is regularly ranked number one in the world, and the consistency of its chart-topping performances shows that success is yet to breed complacency."
University of Cambridge,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-cambridge,6,Europe,United Kingdom,0,"The University of Cambridgeis rich in history - its famous Colleges and University buildings attract visitors from all over the world. But the University's museums and collections also hold many treasures which give an exciting insight into some of the scholarly activities, both past and present, of the University's academics and students.

The University of Cambridgeisone of the oldest universitiesin the world and one of the largest in the United Kingdom. Its reputation for outstanding academic achievement is known world-wide and reflects the intellectual achievement of its students, as well as the world-class original research carried out by the staff of the University and the Colleges. Its reputation is endorsed by the Quality Assurance Agency and by other external reviewers of learning and teaching, such as External Examiners. These high standards are the result of both the learning opportunities offered at Cambridge and by its extensive resources, including libraries, museums and other collections. Teaching consists not only of lectures, seminars and practical classes led by people who are world experts in their field, but also more personalised teaching arranged through the Colleges. Many opportunities exist for students to interact with scholars of all levels, both formally and informally.

There are31 Colleges in Cambridge. Three are for women (New Hall, Newnham and Lucy Cavendish) and two admit only graduates (Clare Hall and Darwin). The remainder house and teach all students enrolled in courses of study or research at the University. Each College is an independent institution with its own property and income. The Colleges appoint their own staff and are responsible for selecting students, in accordance with University regulations. The teaching of students is shared between the Colleges and University departments. Degrees are awarded by the University. Within each College, staff and students of all disciplines are brought together. This cross-fertilisation has encouraged the free exchange of ideas which has led to the creation of a number of new companies. Trinity and St John's have also established science parks, providing facilities for start-ups, and making a significant contribution to the identification of Cambridge as a centre of innovation and technology. In addition to the collections on display in the University's libraries & museums, there is a wealth of sporting and cultural activity at the University of Cambridge, much of it organised by individual clubs and societies run by staff and students. Although the University does not offer courses in the creative arts or sport, there is a strong tradition of achievement in these fields, with many former students going on to gain international standing as artists, performers and athletes. Initiatives ensure that aspiring performers enrich their education with a high level of activity outside the lecture."
ETH Zurich,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/eth-zurich,7,Europe,Switzerland,2,"ETH Zurich is one of the world's leading universities in science and technology and is known for its cutting-edge research and innovation.

Located in Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, ETH Zurich has two main locations: in downtown Zurich and on a modern campus built on a hill in the outskirts of the town. Students at ETH face an intensive workload, but they can still find time for cultural and other leisure activities and for attending the many regular symposia and conferences on campus, where some of the best minds in science come to speak.

ETH students like to exercise their bodies as well as their minds, and there is a wealth of various sports on offer on campus. The largest annual event is the SOLA relay race , taking place in 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometers. More than 900 teams have been known to take part at once in the annual spectacle.

Since the 1880s, students have also been able to show off their best moves at the Poly ball, a classic ball event, featuring live music by several orchestras and bands. Every November, 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and party goers descend on ETH’s extensively decorated main building for what is usually an unforgettable night."

Throop in 1891, with the mission “to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education”. It became a major hub of US scientific research in the early 20th century and was instrumental to the United States’ war effort during World War II.

Today, it is home to the Einstein Papers Project, an initiative seeking to preserve, translate and publish selected papers from the estate of Albert Einstein. It has also established an energy innovation hub that aims to discovery revolutionary methods of generating fuels directly from sunlight.

Cal tech’s 124-acre campus is within walking distance of Old Town Pasadena and the Pasadena Playhouse District, and the two locations are frequent getaways for students. Life on campus is rich with social activities, clubs, associations and recreational facilities. Intercollegiate sport is taken very seriously, with the Cal tech Beavers (the beaver – nature’s engineer – is the college’s mascot) competing in 13 intercollegiate sports.

Cal tech also offers excellent opportunities for the study and performance of music, theater, and the visual arts, all activities that play a vital role in realizing Cal tech’s mission to role in realizing the Institute's mission of ""educating outstanding students to become creative members of society"".

University of Chicago alumni are responsible for the development of many academic disciplines, such as sociology, economics, law, and literary criticism.

The college’s crest sees a phoenix rising from the ashes, a reference to the fire, foreclosure, and demolition of the Old University of Chicago campus, with the current University of Chicago emerging triumphantly in its place in 1890. The old university was founded through a land endowment from the controversial senator Stephen Douglas, a supporter of slavery who authored the Kansas-Nebraska act. By contrast, the new University of Chicago was co-educational and funded through donations from wealthy Chicagoans and the oil magnet John D. Rockefeller.

Today, the University of Chicago has approximately 16,000 students enrolled, with a male to female ratio of 56:44. A quarter of all students hail from overseas, a nod to the institution’s progressive credentials.

Students run more than 400 clubs and societies, which consist of a typical mix of sports teams, arts, cultural and religious groups, academic and political groupings, and societies that promote eclectic common interests. Among the more famous examples are the University of Chicago bowl team, which has won 118 tournaments and 15 national championships, while the university's competitive Model United Nations team was the top ranked team in North America in 2013–14 and 2014–2015.

The admission rate for the class of 2021 was 9.3 percent, of which 46 percent were either black, Hispanic Asian, or Native American. Unusually for an Ivy League school, women comprise over half (54 percent) of all students enrolled.

Penn’s core campus covers more than 279 acres in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus, with the surrounding neighborhood including restaurants and pubs, a large supermarket and cinema.

Student life at Penn serves up opportunities to discover new interests and passions galore, through a wide diversity of social, political, religious, and cultural activities. There are cultural centers and one-of-a-kind museums on campus that allow the arts to play a leading role in student life such as the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, the Arthur Ross Gallery, and Institute of Contemporary Art, which are all major cultural destinations and easy for Penn students to access.

The university also takes sports and recreation very seriously, with students taking part in ice hockey, athletics and joining a variety of competitive, instructional and recreational sports clubs.

With its arts and sciences programs ranking in the top 10 nationally, and the employment prospects for its students among the brightest (Penn boasts one of the highest numbers of graduates who go on to become Fortune 500 CEOs), there is little doubt that the University of Pennsylvania deserves its Ivy League status and reputation."
Cornell University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/cornell-university,16,North America,United States,0,"""I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study,” is the motto of Cornell University, words first uttered by its co-founder Ezra Cornell. Cornell was founded in 1865 with the then radical intention of teaching and making contributions in all fields of knowledge.

Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. These are liberal traditions that Cornell holds dear: a recent article in the Cornell Chronicle heralded the first all-female class admitted to its famous Farrier program in veterinary science. Cornell was also the first university to offer degrees in journalism and the first to teach modern Far Eastern languages.

The main campus of Cornell is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York, overlooking the city and Cayuga Lake. It spreads over 2,300 acres and comprises laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums.

The architecture is an eclectic mix of Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings, international and modernist structures. There are other campuses and facilities in New York City itself such as the medical campus Weill Cornell in Manhattan, and the engineering campus Cornell Tech. Outside New York, Cornell has an outpost in the gulf state of Qatar, which is the first American medical college to open outside of the United States.

Ithaca campus sits at the heart of the Finger Lakes region, surrounded by green space and natural beauty. Students here are as likely to be found sitting under a tree with their nose in a book as they are taking advantage of the many clubs, societies and activities Cornell has to offer.

First-year undergraduates live on North Campus, while upper-level students often hone in on the communities that they have found, opting for a fraternity or sorority, a co-op, a themed residence hall, or an apartment off campus.

There are more than 1,000 organizations on campus, ranging from skateboarding to volunteer programs. Sporty or outdoorsy students can take part in courses as diverse as caving and rope climbing, and there are four sports centers for the fitness inclined.

Food lovers are also well catered for, with Cornell voted in the top ten universities for food, with more than 30 dining facilities across campus."
Tsinghua University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/tsinghua-university,17,Asia,China (Mainland),0,"Students looking for great engineering and computer science programs need look no further than Tsinghua University in Beijing, which since 2015 has been ranked as one of the best in the world for both disciplines.

Tsinghua University was established in 1911 in the wake of the anti-colonialist Boxer Rebellion, which saw the US fine China $30m as punishment. In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt negotiated with Congress a reduction in the sum, with the leftover money earmarked for university scholarships for Chinese students to study in the US. Tsinghua University was established as a preparatory school for the students’ trips abroad.

Today, Tsinghua’s motto of “self-discipline and excellence” has taken it far. Most university rankings place Tsinghua among the best universities in China, and famous alumni include President Xi Jinping himself, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1979. Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger, and Bill Clinton are among the distinguished guests who have spoken at Tsinghua.

The university is academically organized into 20 schools and 57 departments covering a broad range of subjects, including science, engineering, arts and literature, social sciences, medicine. Xinya College was established in 2014 as the school’s residential liberal arts college as part of a series of reforms to undergraduate education. Unlike other Tsinghua students who must choose a specific major upon enrollment, Xinya students can declare their majors at the end of their freshman year.

The campus of Tsinghua University is located in northwest Beijing, in the Haidian district, on the former site of the Qing Dynasty royal gardens. As such it retains Chinese-style landscaping as well as traditional buildings, although many of its buildings are also western in style, reflecting its American heritage. Like its archrival Peking, Tsinghua is known for having one of the most beautiful university campuses.

On campus, students keep themselves occupied with more than just academic study (although the heavy workloads mean studying is always a priority). There are more than 110 student clubs and associations covering interests such as science and technology, health and fitness, humanities, arts and public welfare.

Overseas students are particularly encouraged to join in the fun, with a host of extracurricular such as welcome parties, New Year’s parties, graduation parties, and visits to cultural and historical landmarks."
"University of California, Berkeley (UCB)",https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-california-berkeley-ucb,18,North America,United States,0,"Founded in 1868, the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) is a public research university and the flagship institution of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system.

Berkeley is one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and is home to some world-renowned research institutes, including the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and the Space Sciences Laboratory.

Berkeley alumni, faculty and researchers include 99 Nobel laureates, 23 Turing Award winners, and 14 Pulitzer Prize winners. Faculty member J. R. Oppenheimer led the Manhattan project to create the first atomic bomb, while Berkeley’s Nobel laureate Ernest Lawrence invented the cyclotron, through which UC Berkeley scientists and researchers discovered 16 chemical elements of the periodic table.

Berkeley started out with little more than 40 students but, as the first full-curriculum university in California, it quickly gained ground on its illustrious forebears. By the early 1940s, it had grown substantially and was ranked second only to Harvard.

During this decade, Berkeley gained further prestige through its radiation laboratory, which was instrumental in the project to develop an atomic bomb.  During the sixties, Berkeley gained a worldwide reputation for student activism, thanks to the Free Speech Movement of 1964 and campus opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1969, the then governor of California Ronald Reagan called the Berkeley campus \""a haven for communist sympathizers, protesters, and sex deviants,\"" though today’s students tend to be more politically moderate.

The Berkeley campus encompasses approximately 1,232 acres of the bay area of San Francisco, with many of its Beaux-Arts-style buildings recognized as California Historical Landmarks.

Three quarters of its 40,000 students are undergraduates, giving life on campus a youthful feel in vibrant, urban surrounds. Most undergraduate students live in residential halls, where they can make friends, work and play in a safe environment designed to enhance the academic experience through a culture of care.

There are also student co-ops and not-for-profit housing cooperatives for Berkeley students, with over 1,300 students living in 17 houses and three apartment cooperatives around the Berkeley campus. Students can play sports, and join clubs and societies spanning every imaginable interest. On campus, students can visit the Lawrence Hall of Science, watch sport at the newly-renovated California Memorial Stadium, take in a noon concert, or stroll through Sproul Plaza, the social heart of Berkeley campus."

Yale University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/yale-university,21,North America,United States,0,"Yale University is a private research university and a member of the prestigious Ivy League, a group of America’s most celebrated higher education institutions. Situated in New Haven, Connecticut, the first planned city in America, Yale was founded by English Puritans in 1701, making it the third-oldest higher education institution in the United States.

Today, the city, which is part of the New York metropolitan area, is very much dominated by Yale, though it’s also billed as the “Cultural Capital of Connecticut”. According to the New York Times, New Haven is also extremely picturesque, with “art almost everywhere you look”.

Yale University’s central campus spans 260 acres and includes buildings from the mid-18th century. The university is organized into 14 schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and 12 professional schools.

Undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum which allows you to think and learn across disciplines before deciding upon a major. Perhaps its most distinctive feature, Yale undergraduates are organized into a social system of residential colleges, which allows them to experience the cohesiveness and intimacy of a small school while still enjoying the cultural and scholarly resources of a large university.

A recently unveiled portrait of Barack Obama was by a Yale alumnus, and strolling across the Yale campus, you’ll find that you’re surrounded by public art. Be it in courtyards or plazas, lobbies or lecture halls, art at Yale inspires reflection and offers aesthetic pleasure.

College life is similarly rich, reflecting the diversity of cultures and nationalities on campus. There’s always a packed arts calendar which includes exhibitions at world-class museums and galleries. There’s also a Tony Award-winning theater, Yale Cabaret – a theater-restaurant run by students – and hundreds of student groups, ranging from the serious to the silly.

On top of this, you’ll also find the usual array of top quality sports facilities, a golf course and centers for tennis, polo, sailing, ice hockey, and more as well as competitive sports, with over 30 men’s and women’s varsity teams.

To study at Yale is to join great company: four Yale graduates signed the American Declaration of Independence, and the university has educated five US presidents: William Howard Taft, Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. It is rightly regarded as one of America and the world’s most prestigious universities, with competition to be admitted as fierce as it gets."
EPFL – École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/epfl-ecole-polytechnique-federale-de-lausanne,22,Europe,Switzerland,1,"Its roots can be traced back to the foundation of a private school in 1853, which to start with only had 11 students. Those days are long gone though, with the modern day EPFL one of two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology and student numbers in Lausanne now totaling over 10,000.

Located in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, EPFL is twinned with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich). As part of its research and teaching activities, EPFL is one of the only universities to run a nuclear reactor, a fusion reactor, a Gene/Q Supercomputer, and have P3 bio-hazard facilities.

EPFL has a very singular admissions process, which, for would-be undergraduates who are Swiss nationals, is not selective at all. At the end of freshman year, however, a block exam determines whether students can continue or have to repeat the year, with many home students dropping out entirely at this point.

The EPFL campus lies on the shores of Lake Geneva and consists of 65 buildings across 136 acres. Facilities include banks, bars, two museums – the Mu see Bolo and Archizoom – as well as bars, restaurants and cafeterias.

There are students of 112 different nationalities here, though as of 2014 women made up only 27 percent of the student body. Life on campus is vibrant, with many student-formed clubs and associations providing social and recreational opportunities.

A wide range of sports and leisure facilities keep students physically active while studying. EPFL also has an active student media, publishing the monthly newspaper Flash and there are daily broadcasts on the student radio station.

Another priority on campus is the arts, with the university holding several annual music festivals each year. The largest is Balélec Festival, where 15,000 visitors descend upon the university to watch 30 concerts on two outdoor and four indoor stages."

Johns Hopkins University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/johns-hopkins-university,24,North America,United States,1,"Johns Hopkins University is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. It was founded in 1876, and named after its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins.

It blazed a trail among higher education institutions by being the first US research university, and today it puts more money into research than any other US academic institution. It’s also widely credited with revolutionizing higher education by being the first US institution to integrate teaching and research. To date, Johns Hopkins has spawned 27 Nobel laureates, including the former US president Woodrow Wilson.

Johns Hopkins is organized into 10 divisions on campuses in Maryland and Washington, DC with international centers in Italy, China, and Singapore. Johns Hopkins regularly ranks in the top 10 universities in the US, and is also competitive globally, especially for its undergraduate programs.

Johns Hopkins enrolls more than 24,000 full- and part-time students across its nine academic divisions with faculty members and students studying, teaching, and learning across more than 260 programs in the arts and music, the humanities, the social and natural sciences, engineering, international studies, education, business, and the health professions.

Applicants at undergraduate level are generally ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school class, and over time applications and selectivity has risen. For the class graduating in 2020, the acceptance rate was 11.4 percent.

Most Johns Hopkins undergraduates study at Home wood, a 140-acre North Baltimore campus that is home to the schools of engineering and arts and sciences. It’s a traditional college setting in the heart of a big and blossoming city, with red-brick buildings, tree-lined pathways, an iconic clock tower, and expansive green quads.

Nearly all undergraduates based in the main campus live in residence halls during their first two years, where they make friends and take advantage of what has officially been named one of the best campus dining programs in the US.

There’s also easy access to top class arts and culture: the school’s conservatory, the Peabody Institute, regularly hosts musical extravaganzas, concerts and performances, while the Center for Visual Arts, located next to the Baltimore Museum of Art, provides plenty of sources for artistic inspiration.

Off-campus, students can venture into Baltimore itself, a city with a rich history as a working-class port that has blossomed into a hub of social, cultural, and economic activity – yet retains a small-town feel."

University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-michigan-ann-arbor,45,North America,United States,0,"One of the foremost research universities in the United States, the University of Michigan was founded in 1817, before Michigan had even become a state, and moved from Detroit to what is now its Central campus in Ann Arbor in 1837.

Michigan spans 780 acres, which is made up of its Central and North campuses, two regional campuses, and a center in Detroit. It has a large student body of around 46,000, with undergraduates numbering two-thirds of that number.

Michigan has been lauded for having high standards of research, and the university’s comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as well as professional degrees in architecture, business, medicine, law, pharmacy, nursing, social work, public health, and dentistry.

Michigan's body of living alumni comprises more than a half million people, which is one of the largest alumni bases of any university in the world and a valuable resource for current students when it comes to networking and building industry connections.

Around a quarter of all students are accommodated on campus, with many residence halls serving undergraduates, and family housing that is intended mainly for graduate students. There are also off-campus apartments, houses, and co-operatives, which generally house upper division and graduate students, as well as ‘theme communities’ within residence halls, where students can immerse themselves among peers with similar interests.

Michigan has more than 1,600 clubs and societies, including engineering project teams, community service organizations, and charitable projects. The Michigan Marching Band is over 100 years old and has 350 student members, and other noted musical ensembles include the University of Michigan Men’s Glee Club, a men’s chorus with over 100 members.

Michigan has a history of student activism, and there are a number of groups dedicated to various worth causes. Some, such as the United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS), devote themselves to more left-wing causes, in this case holding to account multinational companies that exploit their workers in factories, but there are also conservative groups such as Young Americans for Freedom, as well as non-partisan groups.

Cultural and ethnical student organizations help students forge smaller communities from the large university population, and publications such as the Michigan Daily, published five days a week during the Fall and Winter terms, allow students to keep abreast of the latest news on campus."

Established on 8th January 1842 by King Willem II, TU Delft has a rich tradition spanning over one and a half centuries, which makes it the oldest technical university in the Netherlands: an institution where world-class research is performed by combining science, engineering and design in a socially responsible manner. While initially focusing on civil engineering the university has gradually added more and more engineering disciplines to the academic programme.

Outstanding facilities

The provision of high quality research and education calls for outstanding facilities. The TU Delft University Library has one of the largest collections of technical and scientific materials in the Netherlands.  TU Delft has eight multidisciplinary research schools and a number of research institutes, all of which are fully equipped and dedicated to innovative research. Other examples of cutting-edge scientific facilities are the unique flight simulator, SIMONA, and the wind tunnels at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering not to mention the second-largest High Voltage Laboratory in Europe housed within the faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science.

A historic university city

Delft is an interesting and historic town located in the province of South Holland between the larger cities of The Hague and Rotterdam, the former being the seat of Dutch government and the latter, with its Europoort, the largest sea terminal in the world. Famous historical figures who once lived and worked in Delft are the painter Johannes Vermeer and the inventor of the microscope, Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek. If you look at the ancient canals lined with merchant’s houses, the old churches and the splendid town hall one sees that Delft’s rich history is still very much alive. At the same time it remains a very modern, safe and vibrant city."

Pennsylvania State University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/pennsylvania-state-university,83,North America,United States,0,"Penn State, founded in 1855 as an agricultural college, admitted its first class in 1859. The Pennsylvania legislature designated Penn State as the Commonwealth's sole land-grant institution in 1863, which eventually broadened the University's mission to include teaching, research, and public service in many academic disciplines. Penn State has awarded more than a half-million degrees, and has been Pennsylvania's largest source of baccalaureate degrees at least since the 1930s. Although the University is privately chartered by the Commonwealth, it was from the outset considered an instrumentality of the state, that is, it carries out many of the functions of a public institution and promotes the general welfare of the citizenry. The Governor and other representatives of the Commonwealth have held seats on Penn State's Board of Trustees since the University's founding, and the legislature has made regular appropriations in support of the University's mission since 1887. Today Penn State is one of four state-related universities (along with the University of Pittsburgh, Temple University, and Lincoln University), institutions that are not state-owned and -operated but that have the character of public universities and receive substantial state appropriations. With its administrative and research hub at the University Park campus, Penn State has 23 additional locations across Pennsylvania and Penn State World Campus, which provides on-line degree offerings.

Nanjing University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/nanjing-university,103,Asia,China (Mainland),1,"Nanjing University is one of China's key comprehensive universities and it functions directly under the Ministry of Education. It is located in the ancient capital of six dynasties -- Nanjing. The University dates back to 1902 when Sanjiang Normal School was founded, and then evolved as Liangjiang Normal School, Nanjing Higher Normal School, National Southeast University, the Fourth Zhongshan University, and National Central University. On August 8, 1949, the National Central University was renamed National Nanjing University. In October 1950, as required by the Ministry of Education, the name was changed to Nanjing University. In 1952, when a nationwide readjustment of universities took place, some schools, such as the School of Engineering and the School of Agriculture, were separated from the University; meanwhile, the University merged with the School of Liberal Arts and the School of Sciences of the University of Nanking, which was founded in 1888. The new university remained Nanjing University and the campus of Nanjing University moved from Sipailou to Gulou. Today, Nanjing University consists of two campuses, one in Gulou and the other in Pukou with a total area of more than 3,600 mu (nearly 600 acres). It is one of the top universities in China, with beautiful campuses and modern teaching and research facilities. Its current President is Professor Jiang Shush eng, a physicist. The University celebrates its anniversary on May 20 of each year. Nanjing University's development has always been closely bound with the destiny of the Chinese nation and linked to her ever changing society. Nanjing Higher Normal University, the predecessor of Nanjing University, played a leading role in the area of Nanjing when the Youth Democratic Movement was held on May 4, 1919. In the early 1920s, it was in this university that a group of Chinese communist forerunners introduced the theory of Marxism to the public. The Second National Conference of Chinese Communist Youth League was also held at the University. During the Anti-Japanese War, organizations like the ""Natural Sciences Forum"" and the ""Democracy and Science Forum"", headed by Pan Shu, Liang Xi and Jin Baoshan, renowned professors of National Central University, eventually became the democratic party ""Jiu San Society."" During the Liberation War, teachers and students of National Central University stood at the forefront through out the democratic patriotic movement. On May 20, 1947, students of National Central University initiated an ""Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War and Anti-Persecution Movement"", later known as the ""May 20th Patriotic Students Movement."" After the National Central University was renamed Nanjing University, the truth-seeking convention was carried forward. In May 1978, one scholar at the Philosophy Department published, in the Guangming Daily, a well-known essay entitled ""Practice Is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth"" and thus evoked ""a heated discussion on the criterion of truth"" that attracted nationwide attention. Since China? s reform and opening, Nanjing University has gradually developed multi-disciplinary programs in humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, technological sciences, life sciences, modern engineering and management. At present, Nanjing University has 17 schools with 50 departments. It runs 74 undergraduate programs, 186 master? s programs (with six programs designated by the University itself), seven professional master? s programs; 16 primary disciplines for doctoral degrees, and 122 Ph. D. programs (with six programs designated by the University itself) as well as 18 post-doctoral stations.

Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/humboldt-universitat-zu-berlin,130,Europe,Germany,3,"The university was founded in Berlin in 1810, and the foundation concept of Wilhelm von Humboldt gave it the title ""Mother of all modern universities"". This concept envisaged a ""Universitas litter arum"" which would achieve a unity of teaching and research and provide students with an all-round humanist education. This concept spread throughout the world and gave rise to the foundation of many universities of the same type over the next century and a half. The concept of the academic and statesman Wilhelm von Humboldt was influenced, among others, by the reform ideas of the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the first vice chancellor of the university, and by the theologian and philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher. From the outset, the university in Berlin had the four classical faculties of Law, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology. Its first academic term began with 256 students and 52 teaching staff. Professors such as Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel (Philosophy), Karl Friedrich von Savigny (Law), August Boeckh (Classical Philology), Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland (Medicine) and Albrecht Daniel Thaer (Agriculture), shaped the profile of the individual faculties in accordance with Humboldt's concept. Partly due to the influence of the natural scientist Alexander von Humboldt, the university pioneered the introduction of many new disciplines. The chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann, the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, the mathematicians Ernst Kummer, Leopold Kronecker, Karl The odor Weierstrass (the ""triple star of Mathematics"") and the medical scientists Johannes Müller and Rudolf Virchow became known in their specialist areas far beyond the university in Berlin.

Mission, Vision, Values and Focus

People come first at the University of Canterbury, reflecting our intrinsic values: whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and tiakitanga. These values are rooted in trust, care and reciprocity, and were embedded over generations of Ngāi Tūāhuriri and Ngāi Tahu presence in the region. In fact, in 1861 Pita Te Hori, the first Upoko of Ngāi Tūāhuriri, instructed the founders of Ōtautahi: “kia atawhai ki te iwi – be kind to your people.” Today, these words underpin the relationships we foster amongst our students, staff and community. We are proud to open our doors to students and staff throughout Aotearoa New Zealand and the world, welcoming everyone to learn from one another and contribute to our diverse and flourishing community. The University of Canterbury is a place for everyone.

Our vision for the University of Canterbury is a contemporary university, a place of learning that is grounded in our shared history, values our differences, and aspires towards research and tertiary education that is equitable and accessible to all. We are determined to remain agile, responsive and pioneering, pushing boundaries to meet the evolving needs of our students. Since the Canterbury Collegiate Union was founded with Henry John Tancred’s inaugural address in 1872, the University of Canterbury has stood for the encouragement of talent without barriers. With our 150th anniversary on the horizon in 2023, we are reflecting on our past so that we can take our successes and our learnings into the future as we set our aspirations for the next 50 years.

Our relationships with manawhenua are integral to these aspirations, as we strive to ensure that Te Tiriti o Waitangi is the bedrock of the University of Canterbury. As we continue to strengthen our partnership and grow our understanding of mātauranga Māori, we are creating a programme of collaborative knowledge creation that sets the University of Canterbury apart. In doing so, we also acknowledge New Zealand as an integral Pacific nation, and embrace the shared whakapapa and reciprocal relationships with our Pacific neighbours.

We seek to cultivate a spirit of curiosity that hon ours those who have gone before us, while contributing to the pool of diverse knowledge that we will in turn pass on to the next generation. In this, we are inspired by the Ngāi Tahu whakataukī: mō tātou, ā, mō ngā uri ā muri ake nei – for us and our children after us. We know that our students are our future, and we believe in empowering them to overcome the challenges of the changing world, and to create a more sustainable, equitable and inclusive future for us all.

The University of Canterburyprovides a learning and research gateway, from the vast expanse of the galaxy and to the depths of the Antarctic continent – offering the connection, understanding and opportunities that will enable us to overcome the challenges facing our society. We pride ourselves on delivering a high standard of education and facilitating creative and innovative research for the benefit of both local and global communities. Our international networks provide opportunities for partnerships, research collaborations and student exchanges.

During the modern era, the University of Tehran evolved from a religious structure to a more modern and academic structure of higher education. Dar-ol-Fonoon College was the first engineering school in its modern form which was established almost a century ago. This was 20 years before the establishment of similar colleges in Tokyo (Japan). Amir Kabir, the Prime Minster of Iran during the Qajar dynasty (1848-1851), having witnessed the modern sciences during his journey to Russia and the Ottoman Empire, established Dar-ol-Fonoon College. Engineering, medical and industrial sciences were among the programs taught at the College. The first instructors of the College were seven professors from Austria. Dar-ol-Fonoon was turned into an official state-run university, the first dean of which was the foreign minister of the time, Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan. The initial plan of turning the College into a national university was ordered by Abdol-Hossein Teimoortash, Minister of the Court of the time to Doctor Isa Sedigh. The plan was ratified by the king, Reza shah. The plan would establish faculties of Theology (Ma’ghool-o-Manghool), Natural, Economics and Engineering Sciences. The Minister of Science at the time, also in charge of implementation of the plan was Ali Asghar Hekmat, whose collections of books are kept at the University’s main library. Other teacher training colleges and Industrial schools became subdivisions of the University to which ad hoc schools and institutions would be added. It was not until 1933 that the plan was passed by the National Parliament. Due to the absence of large buildings, the mansion of the Teachers Training College for example was adopted for the Faculty of Humanities and Literature. The University of Tehran was inaugurated in the winter of 1934. Ali Asghar Hekmat, the Minister of Science, became the first Dean of the University.

University of Luxembourg,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-luxembourg,383,Europe,Luxembourg,8,"Uni. lu - 150 nationalities and the University has teaching program mes in 4 languages: French, German, English and Luxembourgish. The University of Luxembourg, short uni. lu, is more than just another university among many. The concept that uni. lu builds on is in many points unique and certainly does justice to the small country located between Belgium, France and Germany. The University has positioned itself as a multilingual, internationally focused research oriented institution, offering students an extraordinary environment.

Research and education meet the highest international standards and courses are taught in 4 languages: English, German, Luxembourgish and French. Founded in 2003, uni. lu has focused on the Bologna system from the beginning and implemented a well balanced offer of Bachelor and Master program mes in all fields of studies. The Faculty of Science, Technology and Communication offers Bachelors in the domains of engineering, informatics and life sciences as well as Masters in informatics, systems biology, engineering, mathematics and sustainable development.

The Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance concentrates on Bachelor program mes on economic sciences, law and business informatics. The Masters focus on banking and finance, European law, entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as data security management. The Faculty of Language and Literature, Humanities, Arts and Education offers Bachelors in educational and social sciences, psychology and European cultures.

The Master program mes range from philosophy, psychology, European history, mediation and gerontology to cross-border communication and cooperation, European spatial development as well as educational sciences in a multilingual context and Luxembourg Studies. Extensive training offer: Partnerships all around the globe. Only six years after the university's foundation, the University offers 24 Bachelor degrees, 51 Master's degrees, as well as 13 doctoral program mes to offer, with a possibility to carry on with a PhD in many disciplines. Whether English/German, English/French or German/French, many program mes are taught in two languages, some even in three. Moreover, the university also offers several Masters taught entirely in English. Furthermore, worldwide partnerships and exchange program mes are on top of uni. luâ?? s agenda. Whoever completes a Bachelor in Luxembourg will not get around mobility: each graduate has to spend at least one semester abroad. Interchange agreements already exist with universities in 22 countries. At the same time the university is a real multicultural melting pot: 4500 students from 90 countries and professors originating from 20 different countries make currently a ""proportion of foreigners"" of 50 per cent. International flair also beyond the campusLuxembourg is a very international country.

The city accommodates numerous European Institutions, among others the European Court of Justice and the European Investment Bank, and is one of the leading financial cen tres worldwide. Students benefit from this situation in many ways: practitioners from various domains complete the theoretical study offer and make uni. lu a university which meets the requirements of our time. The combination of theory and practice particularly shows on the basis of research units, active in many academic areas, as for example the recently established Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), which dedicates itself to IT-security, and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB).

Research currently focuses on seven future-oriented areas which are security and reliability of information technology, life sciences, material science, European and business law, international finance, educational science and Luxembourg studies.

A personal touch and social responsibility

One of the many advantages appreciated by students is the personal atmosphere. It is easy to have the overlook over the university; everyone knows everyone else on campus and the professors are easy to reach.

Many courses take place in form of seminars, which encourages the active participation of students; Bachelor students are guided in tutorials. It is thus hardly surprising that most of the students do feel quite comfortable in Luxembourg and that they see uni. lu as their multilingual university, as the slogan says of the institution. This well-being effect and the simultaneous excellence of teaching will be improved in the coming years, thanks to the clear acknowledgment of sustainable development.

The university is member of the International Sustainable Campus Network, which aims at the improvement of teaching methods and university infrastructures. Considering all this, one can be sure that those six first years of the University of Luxembourg are only the beginning of a long success story."

The capital of the former Nazarí Kingdom, Granada was the last city in the Iberian Peninsula to be ceded by the Muslims in 1492, an event that resulted in the formation of Spain. The Christian conquest did not taint the city´s brilliance as a cultural center, and sciences and the arts found the best way to develop. The University of Granada was founded in 1531 by Emperor Charles V through a papal bull by Clement VII. In this way, Granada affirmed its status as a university city open to culture, people and beliefs. The institution of Granada continued the tradition of the Arab university of Yusuf I (Madraza, 14th century). With 470 years of tradition, the University of Granada has been the witness of history, from the time of its influence in the social and cultural surroundings of the city up to its development into an intellectual and cultural nucleus in the south of Spain, a period of nearly five centuries. At present it is an institution that is loyal and committed to its environment, so much so that it adheres to the Law of University Reform, which defines universities as cen tres that serve the public, through teaching, research and the lending of services. Due to the protection by the LRU and the autonomy of universities, the University of Granada has faced in the last few years, the largest growth in its history, placing it among some of the best Spanish universities.

University of Florence,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-florence,405,Europe,Italy,1,"The University of Florence can trace its origins to the Studium Gene rale, which was established by the Florentine Republic in 1321. Initially, Civil and Canon Law, Literature, and Medicine were among the subjects taught at the Studium, and various famous scholars were invited to teach there: Giovanni Bocaccio was asked to lecture on the Divine Comedy. However, the importance of the Studium was fully recognized with a Bull by Popo Clemente VI in 1349, in which he officially authorised the Studium to grant regular degrees, extended the Privilegia maxima, and established that the first Italian Faculty of Theology would be in Florence. In 1364, with Emperor Carlo VII, the Florentine Studium became an Imperial University. However, when Lorenzo the Magnificent gained control of Florence and much of Tuscany, the Studium was moved to Pisa, in 1473. Carlo VIII moved it back to Florence from 1497-1515, but with the return of the Medici family it was once again transferred to Pisa. In spite of these moves, many teaching activities continued in Florence, and scientific research found substantial support in the various Academies of the time, like the Crusca and the Cimento. Only in 1859, when the Grand Duke was exiled, were all these separate teaching activities reunited in a suitable system called the Istituto di Studi Pratici e di Perfezionamento; a year later this was recognized as a full fledged university by the Government of Unified Italy. In 1923, with a special Act of Parliament the Instututo was officially denominated a University. Later, the new University was organized into the various faculties: Agriculture, Architecture, Arts, Economics, Education, Law, Mathematics, Physical and Natural Sciences, Medicine and Surgery, Pharmacy, and Political Science. The Faculty of Engineering, where 2-year courses had been offered since 1928, was added to the 10 faculties in 1970."

‘We start providing support to applicants from other countries long before they become HSE University students. For instance, we have a special advisory centre for them. There, we respond to all enquiries about admission and studies at the University. We assist applicants at all stages, from the submission of initial applications, to the selection process, to the provision of documents for enrollment, and, finally, to their arrival in Russia. After an international applicant joins the HSE University family, the Centre for International Student Support takes over and helps them to resolve any issues that may arise, including both academic and everyday matters.’

After graduation, students may decide to stay in Russia and work within their chosen field, or continue their studies under a Master's or doctoral programme at HSE University. There’s also the option of going back to their hometown or country after graduation, and, for the University, this is no less valuable.

From the very start of their studies, students learn how to solve real production and business tasks, and by the time of their graduation, they can quickly and smoothly adjust to today’s job market. Rankings also speak to the demand for HSE University’s alumni and the quality of education at HSE University. We rank among the Top-250 best universities in terms of demand for their alumni by employers in the QS Graduate Employability 2022 ranking, while placing second in Russia for graduate salaries, according to the Super job ranking. For instance, 95% of alumni succeed in finding employment within six months after graduation with an average salary of RUB 125,000 (about USD 1,800)."

Justus-Liebig-University Giessen,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/justus-liebig-university-giessen,497,Europe,Germany,0,"Unlike many other educational systems at the tertiary level, study at German universities is not based on a tripartite structure (eg, B. A. or B. Sc.; then M. A. or M. Sc.; then Ph. D.). A period of basic or junior studies (at least 4 semesters) is normally completed with a so-called intermediate exam (a non-degree exam) and is followed by a phase of advanced or senior studies (at least 6 - 8 semesters). After these advanced studies, students then take their first degree examination in the form of their first state or university examinations. The next level of studies leads directly to the 揚romotion?(doctorate). There are only few possiblities for non-doctoral studies after the first degree, such as German as a Foreign Language as an extension of a first degree in German Language and Literature; Informatics as an extension of a first degree, mag. iuris as extension of law studies completed outside of Germany)Foreign applicants can be accepted as doctoral candidates only if the university degree(s) which they have obtained outside Germany can be judged as equivalent to a German academic qualification. This equivalence is determined by the ""Promotionsausschuss"" (Doctoral Committee of a faculty) upon application for admission. In order to begin your doctoral studies you need to find a professor at Justus Liebig University who represents your subject area and who is willing to become your official supervisor (you will need to present proof of this upon enrolment). The preparation of a doctorate in Germany normally involves the independent preparation of a substantial piece of written research (the dissertation; preparation time 2 to 4 years), and a subsequent oral examination or 'defense' of the dissertation. Coursework and involvement in formal study programs with class examinations are not normally required, but you are allowed to attend courses if you wish. If your non-German university qualification is not accepted as an equivalent first degree, then the only possibility open to you is to continue your previous course of study at the upper level of the appropriate non-doctoral degree program before going for a doctorate ? here problems may arise if the subject of your choice is subject to restriction regarding student numbers. Currently there are about 20,000 students enrolled at Justus Liebig University Giessen, including about 1,700 international students. The 11 departments offer about 150 different courses of study."

Universidad de Costa Rica,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-de-costa-rica,502,Latin America,Costa Rica,1,"The origins of the University of Costa Rica are rooted in the decrees signed in 1843, when the Casa de Enseñanza de Santo Tomás was transformed into a university. By the end of the XIX century, Costa Rica was an oligarchic and liberal country, whose policies focused solely on primary education. Therefore, this led to the closing of the University of Santo Tomas after 45 years of operation. This same decree created the higher schools of Law and Notaries, Medicine, and Engineering. Later, the schools of Pharmacy and Fine Arts were created in 1897. After 1890, higher education in the country was represented by professional schools and colleges that operated under the direction of their respective professional associations, as there was no higher education institution as such. During the first decades of the XX century, a few proposals to create a university were made, but they had no success given the policy that dominated the country. It wasn’t until the 1940s that the reformism in Costa Rica led by Luis Deme trio Tinoco prompted the immediate creation of the University of Costa Rica."

Jawaharlal Nehru University,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/jawaharlal-nehru-university,561,Asia,India,7,"Still a young university, established
by an act of Parliament in 1966, the strength, energy, and reputation of
Jawaharlal Nehru University result from the vision that ideas are a field for
adventure, experimentation and unceasing quest, and that diversity of opinions
are the basis for intellectual exploration. JNU is the place for the
intellectually restless, the insatiably curious, and the mentally rigorous,
giving them the space to grow amidst the calmness of an oasis, a green lung
within the hustle and bustle and the crowds of the capital city of India. Coming
into being in 1969, three years after its establishment by Parliament, JNU
brought frontier disciplines and newer perspectives for old disciplines to the
Indian university system. The excellent teacher-student ratio at 1:10 , the mode of instruction which
encourages students to explore their own creativity instead of reproducing
received knowledge, and of exclusively internal evaluation, were also new to
the Indian academic landscape and have stood the test of time. The very Nehruvian
objectives embedded in the founding of the University–‘national integration, social
justice, secularism, the democratic way of life, international understanding and
a scientific approach to the problems of society’, had built into them constant
and energetic endeavour to renew knowledge through self- questioning. The once rugged terrain of the Aravali hill range,
where 1000 -acre campus is housed is now lush green. Parts of it host dense
forests, sustaining a birdwatcher's paradise and some forms of wild life. The
JNU campus is a microcosm of the Indian nation, drawing students from every
nook and corner of the country and from every group and stratum of society. To
make sure this, annual admission tests are simultaneously held at various cen tres
spread across the length and breadth of the country, and special care is taken
to draw students from the underprivileged castes and ethic groups by reserving
22.5 per cent of seats for them. Overseas students from some 10 percent of the
annual intake. Students' hostels and blocks of faculty residences are
interspersed with one another, underlining the vision of a large Indian family. 
 Grounded in a faith in the unity of knowledge, JNU has sought to avoid the
narrowly conceived Department structure of conventional universities,
preferring instead to bring allied disciplines within a few broad and inclusive
entities called Schools, under whose interactive ambit are placed the more
specialized units, called Cen tres. There are also Special Cen tres that are
outside even the broad structures of School but may grow further. Then there
are Research Clusters that cut across Schools and Cen tres as well as some
program mes, which are placed within specific schools but are built on the
interests of faculty across the university. JNU was the first to offer courses
in foreign languages in an integrated five year MA programme, where their
academic programme, training is largely oriented towards single disciplines(although
all M. A. students are encouraged to do few courses outside their subject)but at
the research level the disciplinary boundaries become more permeable. Work in overlapping
or borderline areas e. g., between environment and literary studies, economics
and science, sociology and aesthetics, or linguistics and biology–is not
uncommon among the Ph. D. students of JNU. Not only are the research scholars
encouraged to cross the invisible walls around disciplines, the relationship
between the academia and the world outside also remains negotiable, often
resulting in mutually beneficial collaboration in areas that form crossroads
for developing an understanding of society, culture and science. JNU has
collaborated with universities across the world in research projects, conferences,
and publications. It has many active MoUs with international and national
universities and exchanges faculty and students with them regularly. We also
host the Indian segment of some international degree program mes. Many faculty and
research scholars have won prestigious national and international awards for
their academic work. Our expertise is highly sought after by the Government and
many members of our faculty have served the Government of India in various capacities
including as Ambassadors/ High Commissioners, and members of the important
bodies like the Planning Commission. Many of our faculty have also served and
serve as Vice Chancellors of other universities. The University brings out four
research journals which have high academic visibility in India and abroad. These
are Studies in History, International Studies, JSL and Hispanic Horizons.
Several JNU faculty also edit national and international journals."

Tulane scientists are also protecting their hometown, the city of New Orleans, and cities worldwide through their work in wetland restoration and preservation and in helping coastal communities adapt to environmental change. In addition, Tulane is home to some of the country’s most influential authors and thinkers and is renowned for its studies of Maya and other ancient civilizations.

With a unique history, location, culture, academic structure and “right-sized” population built for collaboration, Tulane is able to break down the silos and cross boundaries that have traditionally separated academic fields and sometimes thwarted true innovation. As a major research institution, Tulane operates on multiple campuses but is still a university with small class sizes and one-on-one mentoring relationships between students and faculty.

Tulane is located in one of the most culturally diverse and environmentally significant regions of the world. Founded in 1834 as the Medical College of Louisiana with the goal of combating tropical diseases, the university has long been a hub of innovation and interdisciplinary learning and discovery. Tulane is currently embarking on a historic expansion downtown that will place more of its researchers and inventors in the heart of New Orleans’ Bio district where, through its newly established Innovation Institute, it will drive research-based entrepreneurship throughout the city and region.

As the only private national research university in the Gulf South, Tulane embraces the region’s distinctive culture, creativity, and social challenges as inspiration for its research, teaching, and public service."

·        A Short History of IstanbulUniversity

The historyof Istanbul University dates back to the conquest of Istanbul by Sultan MehmetII the Conqueror in 1453. The Sahn-ı Seman Madrasahs (Conqueror Madrasahs), established after the scientific meetings in Zeyrek a day after the conquest, constitute the first ring of this scientific journey. The madrasahs, where theological and environmental sciences were taught together, became centers of attraction with the reconstruction of Istanbul and the invitation of foreign scholars by the Conqueror. Flourishing with the support of the sultans, the madrasahs reached proficient status as higher education institutions particularlyin the 16th and 17th centuries. They were transformed into Darülfünun by SultanAbdülmecid in 1846. The Darülfünun works carried out by Grand Vesir Sait Pasha who tried to keep abreast with the speed of the Industrial Revolution.

Following the proclamation of the Republic, the young Republic of Turkey, in an effort to establish educational system that is based on rationale and science, acknowledged the legal personality of Darülfünun and accepted the scientific and administrative independence of the institution on October 7th, 1925. After this date, the higher education system tried to meet the needs of the new system in terms of academics and materials. The infrastructure for a modern university was set up with the support of foreign scholars invited to the country. With the 1933University Reform, conducted under the leadership of Atatürk, IstanbulDarülfünun was transformed into Istanbul University. Istanbul University started to accept students on November 18th, 1933, as the “first and only”university of the Republic of Turkey.

The creation of the University, the fulfilment of a 40-year dream of the Portuguese Church, constitutes a milestone in modern higher education in Portugal: for the first time the State was not directly involved in and responsible for a university.

Taking advantage of this fact, it has been a pioneer in some respects of university development in Portugal, either with regard to areas of knowledge not previously taught (e. g. business administration and management, food engineering, etc.) or to the regional dispersion of campuses."

The generalization of the practice of looking at complex problems under a mix of articulated lenses allows for more accurate analysis and more effective results creating possibilities for the reinvention of teaching and research practices. The institutional effort for renewal is something that Unifesp has been doing for some years, with profound changes in its organization and following the express mandate of its Institutional Development Plans. A fundamental component of this necessary change in thinking and doing science in Brazil is an active connection to the global state of the art in various knowledge areas. National scientific advances require a strategic and mature international insertion to dialogue in the fronts of scientific discovery, to transgress dated conceptions and to assert international leadership."

University of Bari,https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-bari,836,Europe,Italy,5,"The origin of the University of Bari dates back to 1581, when the ""Collegio della Compagnia del Gesù"" started the University degree in Philosophy and Human Sciences. At the beginning of the 18th Century the new ""illuministic ideology"" pushed forward the needs in the area of physical and natural sciences: as a consequence, curricula in Medicine, Law, Chimes try, and Botanics were activated in Altamura. In 1772 the Royal College moved the Universiy activitiy from Atamura to Bari, including the very outstanding curricula in Legislation and Agriculture. At the beginning of the 19th Century, New University Schools (Licei) were activated by G. Murat in the Apulia Region. Some of these Schools were closed in 1861/2, after the creation of the Italy Nation , other Schools were moved to Naples. At the same time, in order to continue the University activity, it was taken the decision to build the ""Atheneum"" in Bari. The construction started on March 14, 1868. The building was ready on December 28, 1889. The University of Bari was instituted in October 9, 1924, on the foundations of the ancient Graduate Schools of Pharmacy and Notary ship activated immediately after the Unification of Italy as substitutes of the former ""Re ale Liceo delle Pug lie"". In January 1925 the Faculty of Medicine was set up and included the pr e-existing School for Midwives, and the School of Pharmacy was transformed into a Faculty. Successively, other faculties were instituted including the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Economy and Commerce (stemming from the School of Advanced Studies of Commerce founded in 1882) and Agriculture. Since 1944, the University was extended with the institution of the Faculties of Humanities and Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences, Engeneering, Education Sciences, Veterinary Medicine and Foreign Languages. With the four-year Plan 1986/90, the setting up of other University centers in Foggia and Taranto were foreseen. In fact, branches of the Faculties of Law, Economy and Commerce and Agriculture were instituted in Foggia. In particular, a Graduate Course in Food Preparation Sciences was included in the Sillabi of the Foggia Faculty of Agriculture, successively called Science and Alimentary Technology. In addition, in Taranto a Graduate Course on Environmental Sciences with a focus on Marine Environment was instituted as a decentralized branch of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences of Bari. Morever, with the same four-year Plan the Faculty of Architecture was intituted and then transfered jointly at the Faculty of Engeneering into Polite-cnico. Under the reform of the University regulations (n.341/90, and by the virtue of the University Development Program for the three-year period 1991/3, January 31, 1992, the authorization to istitute the following Diploma was granted, Plant Breeding - focus on ""Cropping Techniques for Nursery-Grown Fruit and Vegetable (decentralized branch in Foggia); Animal Breeding - focus on ""Aquaculture and Mariculture""; Animal Breeding - focus on Mariculture, Fishery and Seafood Processing"" (decentralized branch in Taranto); Expert in the field of Cultural Properties; Journalism (decentralized branch in Foggia (not yet operational); Tour operator (not yet operational; Translators and Interpreters (not yet operational); Nursing Science (decentralized Branch in Foggia e Taranto); Economy and Management of Tourist Services (decentralized branch in Foggia); Biology; Pharmaceutical Technologies (decentralized branch in Taranto). In addition, the same three-year Program 1991/3 envisaged the conversion of the Graduate Course of Political Sciences into a full-fledged Faculty (not yet operational) as well as the institution of a Graduate Course of Business Management (decentralized branch in Taranto - not yet operational), and the Graduate Course of Environmental Sciences already operational in Taranto with a focus on Marine Environment. Another item of the above 1991/3 Programma was the institution, starting from January 1rst, 1993, of a Graduate Course of Medecine and Surgery in Foggia stemming from the homologous Faculty of Bari. The University of Bari can also boast an active partecipation in international research project. Indeed, from the point of view of a scientific collaboration many are the agreements of cultural co-operation put into being with both European and American universities as well as with some universities of the People of the Republic of China. The University of Bari is also the headquarters of the Mediterranean Universitiy Community (CUM), founded in 1993 and recognized by UNESCO as a autonomous non governmental body, where converge 158 universities from all over Mediterranean countries."

In this regard, study plans from graduate and undergraduate programs have started to apply for official recognition from Con eau and from international professional bodies like The Royal Institute of British Architects that has recently granted accreditation to the programs taught at the School of Architecture. This process entails on-site inspections and the auditing of the academic policies and procedures that are put in place to improve the quality of education.
