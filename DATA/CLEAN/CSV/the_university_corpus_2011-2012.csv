Established in 1976, UM is the youngest of the 13 public universities in the Netherlands. With almost 16,000 students and 4,000 staff, UM offers a wide choice of academic programmes. UM graduates are highly appreciated on the international labour market and can be found all over the globe, for instance, doing research in Cambridge and Harvard or working for multinationals in countries as varied as Belgium, England, China, the United States, The Gambia, Turkey or Dubai.

Innovative education

Education at UM is unique thanks to both the content of our study programmes and our learning method: Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The strength of PBL lies in its:

International orientation

Maastricht University is a fully bilingual (Dutch & English) university. We offer a wide range of bachelor's, master's and PhD programmes with a strong international and European orientation, most of which are taught in English. Almost half of the student population and a third of our academic staff is non-Dutch, making UM by far the most international university in the Netherlands, and indeed among the most international universities on the European continent.

Each faculty at Maastricht University has dozens of international partnerships and student-exchange agreements, and we encourage interdisciplinary and international collaboration. In addition, UM programmes place heavy emphasis on studying abroad, often including it as a core requirement for graduation.

Multidisciplinary research

Research at UM is based on socially relevant themes that are studied from various disciplines. The university has established a number of research institutes and focuses on multidisciplinary, interfaculty research in: Learning and Innovation, Quality of Life, and Europe and a Globalising World. As an international network university, we have an ingrained culture of collaboration within and between departments, as well as with external institutes, businesses and social organisations in the Netherlands and abroad.

Our research programmes rank among the top in the Netherlands and Europe. We recognise the value of bright, young researchers in contributing to the development of fresh and innovative ideas. That is why research plays an integral role in the majority of our master's programmes and why we offer a number of research master's focused solely on the training of future researchers.

Research and campus initiatives

Though Maastricht University is internationally oriented, it maintains strong ties to the region. Together with the Maastricht University Medical Centre and regional partners we expand our sciences portfolio in areas such as Medical Biotechnology, Neurosciences, Biobased Materials, Systems Biology and Smart Devices. Campuses initiatives as well as the activities of UM Holding and Studium Generale testify to this solidarity.

At UM, we are continually working to further strengthen our position as a research university. To this end, collaboration between the government, business sector and knowledge institutions in the region is crucial. This is what we call the 'triple helix' formula. Such partnerships also help to shape our major campus initiatives:

With these campus initiatives, UM is hoping to enhance its international appeal for top scientific talent, and foster additional opportunities for research funding. This will serve to further anchor the university in the regional economy.",Europe
