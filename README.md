Follow this dropbox link : https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kgtgrrf4rx30w5swwxg8l/HTML_web_scraping.zip?rlkey=wjjxeo3p9zaam34sayrq0a6gy&st=nouuemzh&dl=0 to download all html files needed for the web scraping. Upload those files to this directory DATA/HTML. This step is important because the source code of the Times Higher Education websites collected thanks to a simple requests.get() command is not sufficient as the wbesite loads dynamic content while scrolling though the table taht displays the university ranking.
